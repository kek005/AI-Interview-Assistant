Students should be familiar with Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS or traditionally called just ""Active Directory""). AD DS is a directory service that provides the methods for storing directory data, such as user accounts and passwords, and makes this data available to network users, administrators, and other devices and services. It runs as a service on Windows Server, referred to as a domain controller. Microsoft Entra ID is part of the platform as a service (PaaS) offering and operates as a Microsoft-managed directory service in the cloud. It’s not a part of the core infrastructure that customers own and manage, nor is it an Infrastructure as a service offering. While this implies that you have less control over its implementation, it also means that you don’t have to dedicate resources to its deployment or maintenance. With Microsoft Entra ID, you also have access to a set of features that aren’t natively available in AD DS, such as support for multi-factor authentication, identity protection, and self-service password reset. You can use Microsoft Entra ID to provide more secure access to cloud-based resources for organizations and individuals by:

Configuring access to applications
Configuring single sign-on (SSO) to cloud-based SaaS applications
Managing users and groups
Provisioning users
Enabling federation between organizations
Providing an identity management solution
Identifying irregular sign-in activity
Configuring multi-factor authentication
Extending existing on-premises Active Directory implementations to Microsoft Entra ID
Configuring Application Proxy for cloud and local applications
Configuring Conditional Access for users and devices

The Free tier includes basic features automatically with any new Azure subscription and with Microsoft Online business services like Microsoft 365. The P1 tier offers advanced identity management capabilities, while the P2 tier provides additional features such as identity protection and identity governance. These premium tiers cater to organizations needing more robust identity management and security features."
"Note

By default, when you create a new Azure subscription by using a Microsoft account, the subscription automatically includes a new Microsoft Entra tenant named Default Directory. Some of the more advanced identity management features require paid versions of Microsoft Entra ID, offered in the form of Basic and Premium tiers. Some of these features are also automatically included in Microsoft Entra instances generated as part of Microsoft 365 subscriptions. Differences between Microsoft Entra versions are discussed later in this module. Implementing Microsoft Entra ID isn't the same as deploying virtual machines in Azure, adding AD DS, and then deploying some domain controllers for a new forest and domain. Microsoft Entra ID is a different service, much more focused on providing identity management services to web-based apps, unlike AD DS, which is more focused on on-premises apps. Microsoft Entra tenants
Unlike AD DS, Microsoft Entra ID is multi-tenant by design and is implemented specifically to ensure isolation between its individual directory instances. It’s the world’s largest multi-tenant directory, hosting over a million directory services instances, with billions of authentication requests per week. The term tenant in this context typically represents a company or organization that signed up for a subscription to a Microsoft cloud-based service such as Microsoft 365, Intune, or Azure, each of which uses Microsoft Entra ID. However, from a technical standpoint, the term tenant represents an individual Microsoft Entra instance. Within an Azure subscription, you can create multiple Microsoft Entra tenants. Having multiple Microsoft Entra tenants might be convenient if you want to test Microsoft Entra functionality in one tenant without affecting the others. At any given time, an Azure subscription must be associated with one, and only one, Microsoft Entra tenant. This association allows you to grant permissions to resources in the Azure subscription (via RBAC) to users, groups, and applications that exist in that particular Microsoft Entra tenant. Note

You can associate the same Microsoft Entra tenant with multiple Azure subscriptions. This allows you to use the same users, groups, and applications to manage resources across multiple Azure subscriptions. Each Microsoft Entra tenant is assigned the default Domain Name System (DNS) domain name, consisting of a unique prefix. The prefix, derived from the name of the Microsoft account you use to create an Azure subscription or provided explicitly when creating a Microsoft Entra tenant, is followed by the onmicrosoft.com suffix. Adding at least one custom domain name to the same Microsoft Entra tenant is possible and common.",What is the default directory created when you set up a new Azure subscription with a Microsoft account?,"When you create a new Azure subscription using a Microsoft account, a new Microsoft Entra tenant named Default Directory is automatically included in the subscription."

"This name utilizes the DNS domain namespace that the corresponding company or organization owns. The Microsoft Entra tenant serves as the security boundary and a container for Microsoft Entra objects such as users, groups, and applications. A single Microsoft Entra tenant can support multiple Azure subscriptions. Microsoft Entra schema
The Microsoft Entra schema contains fewer object types than that of AD DS. Most notably, it doesn't include a definition of the computer class, although it does include the device class. The process of joining devices to Microsoft Entra differs considerably from the process of joining computers to AD DS. The Microsoft Entra schema is also easily extensible, and its extensions are fully reversible. The lack of support for the traditional computer domain membership means that you can't use Microsoft Entra ID to manage computers or user settings by using traditional management techniques, such as Group Policy Objects (GPOs). Instead, Microsoft Entra ID and its services define a concept of modern management. Microsoft Entra ID’s primary strength lies in providing directory services; storing and publishing user, device, and application data; and handling the authentication and authorization of the users, devices, and applications. The effectiveness and efficiency of these features are apparent based on existing deployments of cloud services such as Microsoft 365, which rely on Microsoft Entra ID as their identity provider and support millions of users. Microsoft Entra ID doesn't include the organizational unit (OU) class, which means that you can't arrange its objects into a hierarchy of custom containers, which is frequently used in on-premises AD DS deployments. However, this isn't a significant shortcoming, because OUs in AD DS are used primarily for Group Policy scoping and delegation. You can accomplish equivalent arrangements by organizing objects based on their group membership. Objects of the Application and servicePrincipal classes represent applications in Microsoft Entra ID. An object in the Application class contains an application definition and an object in the servicePrincipal class constitutes its instance in the current Microsoft Entra tenant.

3- Compare Microsoft Entra ID and Active Directory Domain Services

You could view Microsoft Entra ID simply as the cloud-based counterpart of AD DS; however, while Microsoft Entra ID and AD DS share some common characteristics, there are several significant differences between them. Characteristics of AD DS
AD DS is the traditional deployment of Windows Server-based Active Directory on a physical or virtual server. Although AD DS is commonly considered being primarily a directory service, it’s only one component of the Windows Active Directory suite of technologies, which also includes Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS), Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS), Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS), and Active Directory Rights Management Services (AD RMS). When comparing AD DS with Microsoft Entra ID, it’s important to note the following characteristics of AD DS:

AD DS is a true directory service, with a hierarchical X.500-based structure. AD DS uses Domain Name System (DNS) for locating resources such as domain controllers. You can query and manage AD DS by using Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) calls. AD DS primarily uses the Kerberos protocol for authentication. AD DS uses OUs and GPOs for management. AD DS includes computer objects, representing computers that join an Active Directory domain. AD DS uses trusts between domains for delegated management. You can deploy AD DS on an Azure virtual machine to enable scalability and availability for an on-premises AD DS. However, deploying AD DS on an Azure virtual machine doesn't make any use of Microsoft Entra ID. Note

Deploying AD DS on an Azure virtual machine requires one or more extra Azure data disks because you shouldn't use drive C for AD DS storage. These disks are needed to store the AD DS database, logs, and the sysvol folder. The Host Cache Preference setting for these disks must be set to None. Characteristics of Microsoft Entra ID
Although Microsoft Entra ID has many similarities to AD DS, there are also many differences. It’s important to realize that using Microsoft Entra isn’t the same as deploying an Active Directory domain controller on an Azure virtual machine and adding it to your on-premises domain. When comparing Microsoft Entra ID with AD DS, it’s important to note the following characteristics of Microsoft Entra ID:

Microsoft Entra ID is primarily an identity solution, and it’s designed for internet-based applications by using HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) communications.",What are the primary differences between Microsoft Entra ID and Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)?,"The primary differences between Microsoft Entra ID and AD DS include their deployment nature and usage. AD DS is a traditional directory service deployed on physical or virtual servers, mainly for on-premises environments, using protocols like LDAP and Kerberos for management and authentication. It also utilizes DNS and OUs/GPOs for management. In contrast, Microsoft Entra ID is a cloud-based identity solution designed for internet-based applications using HTTP and HTTPS communications."

AD DS includes computer objects, representing computers that join an Active Directory domain. AD DS uses trusts between domains for delegated management. You can deploy AD DS on an Azure virtual machine to enable scalability and availability for an on-premises AD DS. However, deploying AD DS on an Azure virtual machine doesn't make any use of Microsoft Entra ID. Note

Deploying AD DS on an Azure virtual machine requires one or more extra Azure data disks because you shouldn't use drive C for AD DS storage. These disks are needed to store the AD DS database, logs, and the sysvol folder. The Host Cache Preference setting for these disks must be set to None. Characteristics of Microsoft Entra ID
Although Microsoft Entra ID has many similarities to AD DS, there are also many differences. It’s important to realize that using Microsoft Entra isn’t the same as deploying an Active Directory domain controller on an Azure virtual machine and adding it to your on-premises domain. When comparing Microsoft Entra ID with AD DS, it’s important to note the following characteristics of Microsoft Entra ID:

Microsoft Entra ID is primarily an identity solution, and it’s designed for internet-based applications by using HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) communications.",How does the authentication protocol differ between AD DS and Microsoft Entra ID?,"AD DS primarily uses the Kerberos protocol for authentication, which is a traditional method used in enterprise networks. Microsoft Entra ID, on the other hand, is designed for internet-based applications and primarily utilizes modern authentication protocols suited for cloud environments, such as OAuth, OpenID Connect, and others that operate over HTTP/HTTPS."

3- Compare Microsoft Entra ID and Active Directory Domain Services

You could view Microsoft Entra ID simply as the cloud-based counterpart of AD DS; however, while Microsoft Entra ID and AD DS share some common characteristics, there are several significant differences between them. Characteristics of AD DS
AD DS is the traditional deployment of Windows Server-based Active Directory on a physical or virtual server. Although AD DS is commonly considered being primarily a directory service, it’s only one component of the Windows Active Directory suite of technologies, which also includes Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS), Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS), Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS), and Active Directory Rights Management Services (AD RMS).

"Microsoft Entra ID is a multi-tenant directory service. Microsoft Entra users and groups are created in a flat structure, and there are no OUs or GPOs. You can't query Microsoft Entra ID by using LDAP; instead, Microsoft Entra ID uses the REST API over HTTP and HTTPS. Microsoft Entra ID doesn't use Kerberos authentication; instead, it uses HTTP and HTTPS protocols such as SAML, WS-Federation, and OpenID Connect for authentication, and uses OAuth for authorization.

When you deploy cloud services such as Microsoft 365 or Intune, you also need to have directory services in the cloud to provide authentication and authorization for these services. Because of this, each cloud service that needs authentication will create its own Microsoft Entra tenant. When a single organization uses more than one cloud service, it’s much more convenient for these cloud services to use a single cloud directory instead of having separate directories for each service. It’s now possible to have one identity service that covers all Microsoft cloud-based services, such as Microsoft 365, Azure, Microsoft Dynamics 365, and Intune. Microsoft Entra ID provides developers with centralized authentication and authorization for applications in Azure by using other identity providers or on-premises AD DS. Microsoft Entra ID can provide users with an SSO experience when using applications such as Facebook, Google services, Yahoo, or Microsoft cloud services.

2- Create user accounts

There are several ways to add cloud identity user accounts in Microsoft Entra ID. A common approach is by using the Azure portal. User accounts can also be added to Microsoft Entra ID through Microsoft 365 Admin Center, Microsoft Intune admin console, and the Azure CLI. Things to know about cloud identity accounts
Let's review how cloud identity user accounts are defined in Microsoft Entra ID. Here's an example of the new User page in the Azure portal. The administrator can Create a user within the organization or Invite a guest user to provide access to organization resources:

Screenshot of the User page in the Azure portal. A new user account must have a display name and an associated user account name. An example display name is Aran Sawyer-Miller and the associated user account name could be asawmill@contoso.com. Information and settings that describe a user are stored in the user account profile. The profile can have other settings like a user's job title, and their contact email address. A user with Global administrator or User administrator privileges can preset profile data in user accounts, such as the main phone number for the company. Non-admin users can set some of their own profile data, but they can't change their display name or account name. Things to consider when managing cloud identity accounts
There are several points to consider about managing user accounts. As you review this list, consider how you can add cloud identity user accounts for your organization. Consider user profile data. Allow users to set their profile information for their accounts, as needed. User profile data, including the user's picture, job, and contact information is optional. You can also supply certain profile settings for each user based on your organization's requirements. Consider restore options for deleted accounts. Include restore scenarios in your account management plan. Restore operations for a deleted account are available up to 30 days after an account is removed.

"Azure PowerShell can be used for bulk upload of user accounts. Things to know about bulk account operations
Let's examine some characteristics of bulk operations in the Azure portal. Here's an example that shows the Bulk create user option for new user accounts in Microsoft Entra ID:

Screenshot that shows the Bulk create user option for new user accounts in Azure AD. Only Global administrators or User administrators have privileges to create and delete user accounts in the Azure portal. To complete bulk create or delete operations, the admin fills out a comma-separated values (CSV) template of the data for the user accounts. Bulk operation templates can be downloaded from the Microsoft Entra admin center. Bulk lists of user accounts can be downloaded. Things to consider when creating user accounts
Here are some design considerations for creating and deleting user accounts. Think about what user account conventions and processes might be required by your organization. Consider naming conventions. Establish or implement a naming convention for your user accounts. Apply conventions to user account names, display names, and user aliases for consistency across the organization. Conventions for names and aliases can simplify the bulk create process by reducing areas of uniqueness in the CSV file. A convention for user names could begin with the user's last name followed by a period, and end with the user's first name, as in Sawyer-Miller.Aran@contoso.com. Consider using initial passwords. Implement a convention for the initial password of a newly created user. Design a system to notify new users about their passwords in a secure way. You might generate a random password and email it to the new user or their manager. Consider strategies for minimizing errors. View and address any errors, by downloading the results file on the Bulk operation results page in the Azure portal. The results file contains the reason for each error. An error might be a user account that's already been created or an account that's duplicated. Generally, it's easier to upload and troubleshoot smaller groups of user accounts. Next unit: Create group accounts


4- Create group accounts

Microsoft Entra ID allows your organization to define two different types of group accounts. Security groups are used to manage member and computer access to shared resources for a group of users. You can create a security group for a specific security policy and apply the same permissions to all members of a group. Microsoft 365 groups provide collaboration opportunities.

This division of roles and responsibilities enables more precise management of access and resources across various departments or schools, as illustrated by the example of a large university with different schools and buildings."
"The university has a team of IT admins who work together to control resource access, manage users, and set policies for the school. Some admins have greater privileges than others depending on the scope of their responsibilities. A central authority is needed to plan, manage, and oversee the complete structure. In this scenario, you can assign administrative units to make it easier to manage the organization. Diagram of administrative units for each university department. Things to think about administrative units
Consider how a central admin role can use administrative units to support the Engineering department in our scenario:

Create a role that has administrative permissions for only Microsoft Entra users in the Engineering department administrative unit. Create an administrative unit for the Engineering department. Populate the administrative unit with only the Engineering department students, staff, and resources. Add the Engineering department IT team to the role, along with its scope. Things to consider when working with administrative units
Think about how you can implement administrative units in your organization. Here are some considerations:

Consider management tools. Review your options for managing AUs. You can use the Azure portal, PowerShell cmdlets and scripts, or Microsoft Graph. Consider role requirements in the Azure portal. Plan your strategy for administrative units according to role privileges. In the Azure portal, only the Global Administrator or Privileged Role Administrator users can manage AUs. Consider scope of administrative units. Recognize that the scope of an administrative unit applies only to management permissions. Members and admins of an administrative unit can exercise their default user permissions to browse other users, groups, or resources outside of their administrative unit. Next unit: Knowledge check

2- Identify Azure regions

Microsoft Azure is made up of datacenters located around the globe. These datacenters are organized and made available to end users by region. A region is a geographical area on the planet containing at least one, but potentially multiple datacenters. The datacenters are in close proximity and networked together with a low-latency network. A few examples of regions are West US, Canada Central, West Europe, Australia East, and Japan West. Things to know about regions
Here are some points to consider about regions:

Azure is generally available in more than 60 regions in 140 countries. Azure has more global regions than any other cloud provider. Regions provide you with the flexibility and scale needed to bring applications closer to your users. Regions preserve data residency and offer comprehensive compliance and resiliency options for customers. Things to know about regional pairs
Most Azure regions are paired with another region within the same geography to make a regional pair (or paired regions). Regional pairs help to support always-on availability of Azure resources used by your infrastructure. The following table describes some prominent characteristics of paired regions:

Characteristic	Description
Physical isolation	Azure prefers at least 300 miles of separation between datacenters in a regional pair. This principle isn't practical or possible in all geographies.",What are some key considerations when selecting an Azure region for your services?,"When selecting an Azure region, it's important to consider factors such as the proximity to end users to reduce latency, data residency requirements, compliance and resiliency options, and the availability of paired regions for high availability and disaster recovery."

3- Implement Azure subscriptions

An Azure subscription is a logical unit of Azure services that's linked to an Azure account. An Azure account is an identity in Microsoft Entra ID or a directory that's trusted by Microsoft Entra ID, such as a work or school account. Subscriptions help you organize access to Azure cloud service resources, and help you control how resource usage is reported, billed, and paid. Diagram that shows the relationship between an Azure subscription and an Azure account, which is an identity in Microsoft Entra ID. Things to know about subscriptions
As you think about the subscriptions to implement for your company, consider the following points:

Every Azure cloud service belongs to a subscription. Each subscription can have a different billing and payment configuration. Multiple subscriptions can be linked to the same Azure account. More than one Azure account can be linked to the same subscription. Billing for Azure services is done on a per-subscription basis. If your Azure account is the only account associated with a subscription, you're responsible for the billing requirements. Programmatic operations for a cloud service might require a subscription ID. Things to consider when using subscriptions
Consider how many subscriptions your organization needs to support the business scenarios. As you plan, think about how you can organize your resources into resource groups. Consider the types of Azure accounts required. Determine the types of Azure accounts your users will link with Azure subscriptions. You can use a Microsoft Entra account or a directory that's trusted by Microsoft Entra ID like a work or school account. If you don't belong to one of these organizations, you can sign up for an Azure account by using your Microsoft Account, which is also trusted by Microsoft Entra ID. Consider multiple subscriptions. Set up different subscriptions and payment options according to your company's departments, projects, regional offices, and so on. A user can have more than one subscription linked to their Azure account, where each subscription pertains to resources, access privileges, limits, and billing for a specific project. Consider a dedicated shared services subscription. Plan for how users can share resources allocated in a single subscription. Use a shared services subscription to ensure all common network resources are billed together and isolated from other workloads. Examples of shared services subscriptions include Azure ExpressRoute and Virtual WAN. Consider access to resources. Every Azure subscription can be associated with a Microsoft Entra ID. Users and services authenticate with Microsoft Entra ID before they access resources.",What is the role of an Azure subscription in managing cloud services?,"An Azure subscription acts as a logical unit of Azure services linked to an Azure account, which helps organize access to resources and manage billing and payment configurations.

Subscriptions help you organize access to Azure cloud service resources, and help you control how resource usage is reported, billed, and paid. Diagram that shows the relationship between an Azure subscription and an Azure account, which is an identity in Microsoft Entra ID. Things to know about subscriptions
As you think about the subscriptions to implement for your company, consider the following points:

Every Azure cloud service belongs to a subscription. Each subscription can have a different billing and payment configuration. Multiple subscriptions can be linked to the same Azure account. More than one Azure account can be linked to the same subscription. Billing for Azure services is done on a per-subscription basis. If your Azure account is the only account associated with a subscription, you're responsible for the billing requirements. Programmatic operations for a cloud service might require a subscription ID. Things to consider when using subscriptions
Consider how many subscriptions your organization needs to support the business scenarios. As you plan, think about how you can organize your resources into resource groups. Consider the types of Azure accounts required. Determine the types of Azure accounts your users will link with Azure subscriptions. You can use a Microsoft Entra account or a directory that's trusted by Microsoft Entra ID like a work or school account. If you don't belong to one of these organizations, you can sign up for an Azure account by using your Microsoft Account, which is also trusted by Microsoft Entra ID. Consider multiple subscriptions. Set up different subscriptions and payment options according to your company's departments, projects, regional offices, and so on. A user can have more than one subscription linked to their Azure account, where each subscription pertains to resources, access privileges, limits, and billing for a specific project. Consider a dedicated shared services subscription. Plan for how users can share resources allocated in a single subscription. Use a shared services subscription to ensure all common network resources are billed together and isolated from other workloads. Examples of shared services subscriptions include Azure ExpressRoute and Virtual WAN. Consider access to resources. Every Azure subscription can be associated with a Microsoft Entra ID. Users and services authenticate with Microsoft Entra ID before they access resources.",What are the potential benefits of using a shared services subscription in Azure?,"A shared services subscription allows all common network resources to be billed together and isolated from other workloads, ensuring efficient management and centralized billing. Examples include Azure ExpressRoute and Virtual WAN, which facilitate resource sharing and centralized access control."

"Next unit: Create Azure policies

4- Create Azure policies

Azure Administrators use Azure Policy to create policies that define conventions for resources. A policy definition describes the compliance conditions for a resource, and the actions to complete when the conditions are met. One or more policy definitions are grouped into an initiative definition, to control the scope of your policies and evaluate the compliance of your resources. Diagram that shows an initiative definition for a group of policy definitions that are applied to resources. There are four basic steps to create and work with policy definitions in Azure Policy. Step 1: Create policy definitions
A policy definition expresses a condition to evaluate and the actions to perform when the condition is met. You can create your own policy definitions, or choose from built-in definitions in Azure Policy. You can create a policy definition to prevent VMs in your organization from being deployed, if they're exposed to a public IP address. Step 2: Create an initiative definition
An initiative definition is a set of policy definitions that help you track your resource compliance state to meet a larger goal. You can create your own initiative definitions, or use built-in definitions in Azure Policy. You can use an initiative definition to ensure resources are compliant with security regulations. Step 3: Scope the initiative definition
Azure Policy lets you control how your initiative definitions are applied to resources in your organization. You can limit the scope of an initiative definition to specific management groups, subscriptions, or resource groups. Step 4: Determine compliance
After you assign an initiative definition, you can evaluate the state of compliance for all your resources. Individual resources, resource groups, and subscriptions within a scope can be exempted from having the policy rules affect it. Exclusions are handled individually for each assignment. Next unit: Create policy definitions

5- Create policy definitions

Azure Policy offers built-in policy definitions to help you quickly configure control conditions for your resources. In addition to the built-in policies, you can also create your own definitions, or import definitions from other sources. Access built-in policy definitions
You can sort the list of built-in definitions by category to search for policies that meet your business needs. Screenshot that shows a list of built-in policy definitions in Azure Policy. Here are some examples of built-in policy definitions:

Allowed virtual machine size SKUs: Specify a set of VM size SKUs that your organization can deploy. This policy is located under the Compute category. Allowed locations: Restrict the locations users can specify when deploying resources. Use this policy to enforce your geo-compliance requirements.",What are the steps involved in creating and working with policy definitions in Azure Policy?,"The steps involved in creating and working with policy definitions in Azure Policy include: creating policy definitions that express conditions to evaluate and actions to perform, creating an initiative definition to group policy definitions and track compliance, scoping the initiative definition to specific management groups, subscriptions, or resource groups, and finally determining compliance by evaluating the state of compliance for all resources within the scope."

4- Create Azure policies

Azure Administrators use Azure Policy to create policies that define conventions for resources. A policy definition describes the compliance conditions for a resource, and the actions to complete when the conditions are met. One or more policy definitions are grouped into an initiative definition, to control the scope of your policies and evaluate the compliance of your resources. Diagram that shows an initiative definition for a group of policy definitions that are applied to resources. There are four basic steps to create and work with policy definitions in Azure Policy. Step 1: Create policy definitions
A policy definition expresses a condition to evaluate and the actions to perform when the condition is met. You can create your own policy definitions, or choose from built-in definitions in Azure Policy. You can create a policy definition to prevent VMs in your organization from being deployed, if they're exposed to a public IP address. Step 2: Create an initiative definition

Identify features and use cases for role-based access control. List and create role definitions. Create role assignments. Identify differences between Azure RBAC and Microsoft Entra roles. Manage access to subscriptions with RBAC. Review built-in Azure RBAC roles. 1- Introduction

Azure Administrators need to secure access to their Azure resources like virtual machines (VMs), websites, networks, and storage. Administrators need mechanisms to help them manage who can access their resources, and what actions are allowed. Organizations that do business in the cloud recognize that securing their resources is a critical function of their infrastructure. In this module, your business is investigating how to ensure their corporate data and assets are protected. They want secure protection that enables them to control access to their data and resources by specifying roles and access privileges for employees and business partners. You're responsible for researching how to use role-based access control (RBAC) to accomplish these tasks. You need to ensure the company assets are protected, and also support user access to the resources. The goal of this module is to understand the features and use cases for Azure role-based access control (RBAC). You learn how to create role definitions and role assignments, and find and use built-in Azure RBAC roles.","What is the purpose of role-based access control (RBAC) in Azure, and what are its key features?","The purpose of role-based access control (RBAC) in Azure is to secure access to Azure resources while allowing users to access the resources they need. Key features include identifying use cases for RBAC, creating and assigning roles, managing subscription access, and differentiating between Azure RBAC and Microsoft Entra roles."

2- Implement role-based access control

Secure access management for cloud resources is critical for businesses that operate in the cloud. Role-based access control (RBAC) is a mechanism that can help you manage who can access your Azure resources. RBAC lets you determine what operations specific users can do on specific resources, and control what areas of a resource each user can access. Azure RBAC is an authorization system built on Azure Resource Manager. Azure RBAC provides fine-grained access management of resources in Azure. Things to know about Azure RBAC
Here are some things you can do with Azure RBAC:

Allow an application to access all resources in a resource group. Allow one user to manage VMs in a subscription, and allow another user to manage virtual networks. Allow a database administrator (DBA) group to manage SQL databases in a subscription. Allow a user to manage all resources in a resource group, such as VMs, websites, and subnets. Azure RBAC concepts
The following table describes the core concepts of Azure RBAC. Concept	Description	Examples
Security principal	An object that represents something that requests access to resources. User, group, service principal, managed identity
Role definition	A set of permissions that lists the allowed operations. Azure RBAC comes with built-in role definitions, but you can also create your own custom role definitions.",What are the main differences between Azure RBAC and Microsoft Entra roles?,"Azure RBAC is an authorization system specifically designed for managing access to Azure resources, focusing on operations that users can perform on those resources. In contrast, Microsoft Entra roles pertain to broader identity and access management within Microsoft's cloud-based identity services. While Azure RBAC is more resource-centric, Microsoft Entra roles are centered around identity and permissions management across various services."

- Assign the Contributor role to a user scoped to a subscription
Things to consider when using Azure RBAC
As you think about how you can implement roles and scope assignments within your organization, consider these points:

Consider your requestors. Plan your strategy to accommodate for all types of access to your resources. Security principals are created for anything that requests access to your resources. Determine who are the requestors in your organization. Requestors can be internal or external users, groups of users, applications and services, resources, and so on. Consider your roles. Examine the types of job responsibilities and work scenarios in your organization. Roles are commonly built around the requirements to fulfill job tasks or complete work goals. Certain users like administrators, corporate controllers, and engineers can require a level of access beyond what most users need. Some roles can be defined to provide the same access for all members of a team or department for specific resources or applications. Consider scope of permissions. Think about how you can ensure security by controlling the scope of permissions for role assignments. Outline the types of permissions and levels of scope that you need to support. You can apply different scope levels for a single role to support requestors in different scenarios. Consider built-in or custom definitions. Review the built-in role definitions in Azure RBAC. Built-in roles can be used as-is, or adjusted to meet the specific requirements for your organization. You can also create custom role definitions from scratch. Next unit: Create a role definition

3- Create a role definition

A role definition consists of sets of permissions that are defined in a JSON file. Each permission set has a name, such as Actions or NotActions that describe the permissions. Some examples of permission sets include:

Actions permissions identify what actions are allowed. NotActions permissions specify what actions aren't allowed. DataActions permissions indicate how data can be changed or used. AssignableScopes permissions list the scopes where a role definition can be assigned. The following diagram shows details for the Contributor role in Azure RBAC.",What is a role assignment in Azure RBAC and how does it function?,"A role assignment in Azure RBAC involves attaching a role definition to a security principal at a particular scope.

Similar to a role assignment, a deny assignment attaches a set of deny actions to a user, group, or service principal at a particular scope for the purpose of denying access. Deny assignments block users from performing specific Azure resource actions even if a role assignment grants them access. Next unit: Create a role assignment

4- Create a role assignment

A role assignment is the process of scoping a role definition to limit permissions for a requestor, such as a user, group, service principal, or managed identity.",How do deny assignments enhance security in Azure RBAC?,"Deny assignments enhance security in Azure RBAC by allowing administrators to attach a set of deny actions to a user, group, or service principal at a specific scope. This feature blocks users from performing certain Azure resource actions, even if their role assignment grants them access. Deny assignments help enforce strict access control policies, ensuring that users cannot perform unauthorized actions, thus strengthening the organization's overall security posture."
"Things to know about role assignments
Review the following characteristics of role assignments:

The purpose of a role assignment is to control access. The scope limits which permissions defined for a role are available for the assigned requestor. Access is revoked by removing a role assignment. A resource inherits role assignments from its parent resource. The effective permissions for a requestor are a combination of the permissions for the requestor's assigned roles, and the permissions for the roles assigned to the requested resources. Things to consider when assigning scope levels for roles
The following diagram shows an example of how scopes can be applied for a role to grant varying levels of access for different users. Think about how you can implement scopes for your roles to create meaningful assignments for your organization. Diagram that shows how a role assignment is created for a service principal, role definition, and access scope level. This scenario has the following access management configuration:

Three security principals are supported: user, group, service principal. Six built-in roles are implemented, and two custom roles are defined: Reader Support Tickets and Virtual Machine Operator. The built-in Contributor role has two sets of permissions: Actions and NotActions. The Contributor role is assigned at different scopes to the Marketing and Pharma-sales resource groups:

Marketing users are granted access to create or manage any Azure resource in the Pharma-sales resource group. Marketing users aren't granted access to resources outside the Pharma-sales resource group. Next unit: Compare Azure roles to Microsoft Entra roles

Three types of roles are available for access management in Azure:

Classic subscription administrator roles

Azure role-based access control (RBAC) roles

Microsoft Entra administrator roles

To better understand how these different roles are defined and implemented in Azure, it helps to know some of the history. When Azure was initially released, access to resources was managed with just three administrator roles: Account Administrator, Service Administrator, and Co-Administrator. Access was controlled by assigning admin roles to subscriptions. Later, role-based access control (RBAC) for Azure resources was added. Azure RBAC is a newer authorization system that provides fine-grained access management to Azure resources. RBAC includes many built-in roles that can be assigned at different scopes. The Azure RBAC model also lets you create your own custom roles. In addition to Azure RBAC roles, Microsoft Entra ID provides built-in administrator roles to manage Microsoft Entra resources like users, groups, and domains.",What is the primary purpose of a role assignment in Azure?,The primary purpose of a role assignment in Azure is to control access by defining which permissions are available for an assigned requestor and limiting these permissions through specific scopes.

Next unit: What are user accounts in Microsoft Entra ID? 2- What are user accounts in Microsoft Entra ID? In Microsoft Entra ID, all user accounts are granted a set of default permissions. A user's account access consists of the user type, their role assignments, and their ownership of individual objects. There are different types of user accounts in Microsoft Entra ID. Each type has a level of access specific to the scope of work expected to be done under each type of user account. Administrators have the highest level of access, followed by the member user accounts in the Microsoft Entra organization. Guest users have the most restricted level of access. Permissions and roles

4- Manage app and resource access by using Microsoft Entra groups

You want to give all the developers within your organization the same access. You also want to manage who's part of the Developers group and who isn't. Microsoft Entra ID helps you to manage your cloud-based apps, on-premises apps, and resources by using your organization's groups. Your resources can be part of the Microsoft Entra organization, such as permissions to manage objects through roles, or your resources can be external to the organization, like software as a service (SaaS) apps, Azure services, SharePoint sites, and on-premises resources. Access management in Microsoft Entra ID
Microsoft Entra roles: Use Microsoft Entra roles to manage Microsoft Entra ID-related resources like users, groups, billing, licensing, application registration, and more. Role-based access control (RBAC) for Azure resources: Use RBAC roles to manage access to Azure resources like virtual machines, SQL databases, or storage. For example, you could assign an RBAC role to a user to manage and delete SQL databases in a specific resource group or subscription. Access rights through single user or group assignment
Microsoft Entra ID helps you provide access rights to a single user or to a group of users. You can assign a set of access permissions to all the members of the group. Access permissions range from full access to the ability to create or remove resources. There are different ways you can assign access rights:

Direct assignment: Assign a user the required access rights by directly assigning a role that has those access rights. Group assignment: Assign a group the required access rights, and the group members will inherit those rights. Rule-based assignment: Use rules to determine a group membership based on user or device properties. For a user account or device's group membership to be valid, the user or device must meet the rules. If the rules aren't met, the user account or device's group membership is no longer valid. The rules can be simple. You can select prewritten rules or write your own advanced rules. In the next exercise, we'll assign users to a Microsoft Entra group and use rule-based assignment to automatically manage their group membership.

6- Collaborate by using guest accounts and Microsoft Entra B2B

You want the external team to collaborate with the internal developer team in a process that's easy and secure. With Microsoft Entra business to business (B2B), you can add people from other companies to your Microsoft Entra tenant as guest users. If your organization has multiple Microsoft Entra tenants, you might also want to use Microsoft Entra B2B to give a user in tenant A access to resources in tenant B. Each Microsoft Entra tenant is distinct and separate from other Microsoft Entra tenants and has its own representation of identities and app registrations. Guest user access in Microsoft Entra B2B
In any scenario where external users need temporary or restricted access to your organization's resources, give them guest user access. You can grant guest user access with the appropriate restrictions in place, then remove access when the work is done. You can use the Azure portal to invite B2B collaboration users. Invite guest users to the Microsoft Entra organization, group, or application. After you invite a user, their account is added to Microsoft Entra ID as a guest account. The guest can get the invitation through email, or you can share the invitation to an application by using a direct link. The guest then redeems their invitation to access the resources. By default, users and administrators in Microsoft Entra ID can invite guest users, but the Global Administrator can limit or disable this ability. Collaborate with any partner by using their identities
If your organization has to manage the identities of each external guest user who belongs to a given partner organization, it faces increased responsibilities because it has to secure those identities. There's an increased workload to manage and administer those identities. You also have to sync accounts, manage each account's lifecycle, and track each individual external account to meet your obligations. Your organization has to follow this procedure for every partner organization with which it wants to collaborate. Also, if something happens to those accounts, your organization is liable. With Microsoft Entra B2B, you don't have to manage your external users' identities. The partner is responsible for managing its own identities. External users continue to use their current identities to collaborate with your organization.",What is the benefit of using Microsoft Entra B2B for external collaboration?,"The benefit of using Microsoft Entra B2B for external collaboration is that it allows people from other companies to be added as guest users to your Microsoft Entra tenant, enabling easy and secure collaboration without the need to manage external users' identities, as the partner organization is responsible for managing its own identities."

However, with Microsoft Entra B2B, these responsibilities are reduced as the partner organization manages its own identities."
"For example, say you work with the external partner Giovanna Carvalho at Proseware. Her organization manages her identity as gcarvalho@proseware.com. You use that identity for the guest account in your organization's Microsoft Entra ID. After Giovanna redeems the guest account invitation, she uses the same identity (name and password) for the guest account as she does for her organization. Why use Microsoft Entra B2B instead of federation? With Microsoft Entra B2B, you don't take on the responsibility of managing and authenticating partners' credentials and identities. Your partners can collaborate with you even if they don't have an IT department. For example, you can collaborate with a contractor who only has a personal or business email address and no identity management solution managed by an IT department. Giving access to external users is much easier than in a federation. You don't need an administrator to create and manage external user accounts. Any authorized user can invite other users. A line manager could, for example, invite external users to collaborate with their team. When collaboration is no longer needed, you can easily remove these external users. A federation is more complex. A federation is where you have a trust established with another organization, or a collection of domains, for shared access to a set of resources. You might be using an on-premises identity provider and authorization service like Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) that has an established trust with Microsoft Entra ID. To get access to resources, all users have to provide their credentials and successfully authenticate against the AD FS server. If you have someone trying to authenticate outside the internal network, you need to set up a web application proxy. The architecture might look something like the following diagram:

Diagram that shows a federation example between an on-premises Active Directory and Microsoft Entra ID. An on-premises federation with Microsoft Entra ID might be good if your organization wants all authentication to Azure resources to happen in the local environment. Administrators can implement more rigorous levels of access control, but this means that if your local environment is down, users can't access the Azure resources and services they need. With a B2B collaboration, external teams get the required access to Azure resources and services with the appropriate permissions. There's no need for a federation and trust to be established, and authentication doesn't depend on an on-premises server. Authentication is done directly through Azure. Collaboration becomes simplified, and you don't have to worry about situations where users can't sign in because an on-premises directory isn't available.",What are the key advantages of using Microsoft Entra B2B over a federation for managing external partner collaborations?,"Microsoft Entra B2B allows organizations to avoid the responsibility of managing and authenticating partners' credentials and identities, enabling partners to collaborate even without an IT department. It simplifies the process of giving access to external users, as any authorized user can invite others without administrative intervention. Additionally, there is no need to establish a trust with another organization, and authentication is done directly through Azure, making collaboration easier and more reliable."

Diagram that shows a federation example between an on-premises Active Directory and Microsoft Entra ID. An on-premises federation with Microsoft Entra ID might be good if your organization wants all authentication to Azure resources to happen in the local environment. Administrators can implement more rigorous levels of access control, but this means that if your local environment is down, users can't access the Azure resources and services they need. With a B2B collaboration, external teams get the required access to Azure resources and services with the appropriate permissions. There's no need for a federation and trust to be established, and authentication doesn't depend on an on-premises server. Authentication is done directly through Azure. Collaboration becomes simplified, and you don't have to worry about situations where users can't sign in because an on-premises directory isn't available.",Why might an organization choose to implement a federation despite its complexity compared to Microsoft Entra B2B?,"An organization might choose to implement a federation if it desires all authentication to Azure resources to occur within the local environment, allowing for more rigorous levels of access control. This approach requires establishing a trust with another organization and can provide a higher level of security control, which might be necessary for certain compliance or operational requirements."

"Striking the right balance between autonomy and central governance; for example, giving project teams the ability to create and manage virtual machines in the cloud while centrally controlling the networks those VMs use to communicate with other resources. Microsoft Entra ID and Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) work together to make it simple to carry out these goals. Azure subscriptions
First, remember that each Azure subscription is associated with a single Microsoft Entra directory. Users, groups, and applications in that directory can manage resources in the Azure subscription. The subscriptions use Microsoft Entra ID for single sign-on (SSO) and access management. You can extend your on-premises Active Directory to the cloud by using Microsoft Entra Connect. This feature allows your employees to manage their Azure subscriptions by using their existing work identities. When you disable an on-premises Active Directory account, it automatically loses access to all Azure subscriptions connected with Microsoft Entra ID. What's Azure RBAC? Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) is an authorization system built on Azure Resource Manager that provides fine-grained access management for resources in Azure. With Azure RBAC, you can grant the exact access that users need to do their jobs. For example, you can use Azure RBAC to let one employee manage virtual machines in a subscription while another manages SQL databases within the same subscription. The following video describes Azure RBAC in detail:


You can grant access by assigning the appropriate Azure role to users, groups, and applications at a certain scope. The scope of a role assignment can be a management group, subscription, a resource group, or a single resource. A role assigned at a parent scope also grants access to the child scopes contained within it. For example, a user with access to a resource group can manage all the resources it contains, like websites, virtual machines, and subnets. The Azure role that you assign dictates what resources the user, group, or application can manage within that scope.

A role assignment at a higher scope, such as an entire subscription, is inherited by child scopes contained within it. For example, if a role is assigned at the subscription level, it grants access to all resources within that subscription, including service instances and resource groups. This hierarchical system ensures that permissions are efficiently propagated to relevant resources."
"Although it's not obvious from the diagram, a resource can be bound to only one resource group. What can I do with Azure RBAC? Azure RBAC allows you to grant access to Azure resources that you control. Suppose you need to manage access to resources in Azure for the development, engineering, and marketing teams. You’ve started to receive access requests, and you need to quickly learn how access management works for Azure resources. Here are some scenarios you can implement with Azure RBAC:

Allow one user to manage virtual machines in a subscription and another user to manage virtual networks
Allow a database administrator group to manage SQL databases in a subscription
Allow a user to manage all resources in a resource group, such as virtual machines, websites, and subnets
Allow an application to access all resources in a resource group
Azure RBAC in the Azure portal
In several areas in the Azure portal, you'll see a pane named Access control (IAM), also known as identity and access management. On this pane, you can see who has access to that area and their role. Using this same pane, you can grant or remove access. The following shows an example of the Access control (IAM) pane for a resource group. In this example, Alain has been assigned the Backup Operator role for this resource group. Screenshot of the Azure portal showing the Access control Role assignment pane with the Backup operator section highlighted. How does Azure RBAC work? You can control access to resources using Azure RBAC by creating role assignments, which control how permissions are enforced. To create a role assignment, you need three elements: a security principal, a role definition, and a scope. You can think of these elements as ""who,"" ""what,"" and ""where."" 1. Security principal (who)
A security principal is just a fancy name for a user, group, or application to which you want to grant access. An illustration showing security principal including user, group, and service principal. 2. Role definition (what you can do)
A role definition is a collection of permissions. It's sometimes just called a role. A role definition lists the permissions the role can perform, such as read, write, and delete. Roles can be high-level, like Owner, or specific, like Virtual Machine Contributor. An illustration listing different built-in and custom roles with zoom-in on the definition for the contributor role. Azure includes several built-in roles that you can use.",What is the purpose of Azure RBAC in managing access to Azure resources?,"Azure RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) allows you to grant access to Azure resources that you control. It enables you to manage access for different teams by assigning them specific roles and permissions, ensuring that only authorized users can access and manage resources within your Azure environment."
"Although it's not obvious from the diagram, a resource can be bound to only one resource group. What can I do with Azure RBAC? Azure RBAC allows you to grant access to Azure resources that you control. Suppose you need to manage access to resources in Azure for the development, engineering, and marketing teams. You’ve started to receive access requests, and you need to quickly learn how access management works for Azure resources. Here are some scenarios you can implement with Azure RBAC:

Allow one user to manage virtual machines in a subscription and another user to manage virtual networks
Allow a database administrator group to manage SQL databases in a subscription
Allow a user to manage all resources in a resource group, such as virtual machines, websites, and subnets
Allow an application to access all resources in a resource group

The security principal represents ""who"" is being granted access (such as a user, group, or application), the role definition represents ""what"" permissions are being granted (such as read, write, delete), and the scope represents ""where"" the permissions apply (such as a specific resource group or subscription)."
"The following lists four fundamental built-in roles:

Owner: Has full access to all resources, including the right to delegate access to others
Contributor: Can create and manage all types of Azure resources, but can’t grant access to others
Reader: Can view existing Azure resources
User Access Administrator: Lets you manage user access to Azure resources
If the built-in roles don't meet the specific needs of your organization, you can create your own custom roles. 3. Scope (where)
Scope is the level where the access applies. This is helpful if you want to make someone a Website Contributor, but only for one resource group. In Azure, you can specify a scope at multiple levels: management group, subscription, resource group, or resource. Scopes are structured in a parent-child relationship. When you grant access at a parent scope, those permissions are inherited by the child scopes. For example, if you assign the Contributor role to a group at the subscription scope, that role is inherited by all resource groups and resources in the subscription. An illustration showing a hierarchical representation of different Azure levels to apply scope. The hierarchy, starting with the highest level, is in this order: Management group, subscription, resource group, and resource. Role assignment
Once you have determined the who, what, and where, you can combine those elements to grant access. A role assignment is the process of binding a role to a security principal at a particular scope for the purpose of granting access. To grant access, you'll create a role assignment. To revoke access, you'll remove a role assignment. The following example shows how the Marketing group has been assigned the Contributor role at the sales resource group scope. An illustration showing a sample role assignment process for Marketing group, which is a combination of security principal, role definition, and scope. The Marketing group falls under the Group security principal and has a Contributor role assigned for the Resource group scope. Azure RBAC is an allow model
Azure RBAC is an allow model. This means that when you're assigned a role, Azure RBAC allows you to perform certain actions, such as read, write, or delete. So, if one role assignment grants you read permissions to a resource group and a different role assignment grants you write permissions to the same resource group, you'll have read and write permissions on that resource group. Azure RBAC has something called NotActions permissions. You can use NotActions to create a set of not allowed permissions. The access a role grants—the effective permissions—is computed by subtracting the NotActions operations from the Actions operations.","What are the four fundamental built-in roles in Azure RBAC, and what are their primary functions?","The four fundamental built-in roles in Azure RBAC are Owner, Contributor, Reader, and User Access Administrator. The Owner role has full access to all resources and can delegate access to others. The Contributor can create and manage all types of Azure resources but cannot grant access to others. The Reader can view existing Azure resources. The User Access Administrator manages user access to Azure resources."

"How SSPR works
The user initiates a password reset either by going directly to the password-reset portal or by selecting the Can't access your account link on a sign-in page. The reset portal takes these steps:

Localization: The portal checks the browser's locale setting and renders the SSPR page in the appropriate language. Verification: The user enters their username and passes a captcha to ensure that it's a user and not a bot. Authentication: The user enters the required data to authenticate their identity. They might, for example, enter a code or answer security questions. Password reset: If the user passes the authentication tests, they can enter a new password and confirm it. Notification: A message is sent to the user to confirm the reset. There are several ways you can customize the SSPR user experience. For example, you can add your company logo to the sign-in page so users know they're in the right place to reset their password. Authenticate a password reset
It's critical to verify a user's identity before you allow a password reset. Malicious users might exploit any weakness in the system to impersonate that user. Azure supports six different ways to authenticate reset requests. As an administrator, you can choose the methods to use when you configure SSPR. Enable two or more of these methods so that users can choose the ones they can easily use. The methods are:

Authentication method	How to register	How to authenticate for a password reset
Mobile app notification	Install the Microsoft Authenticator app on your mobile device, then register it on the multifactor authentication setup page. Azure sends a notification to the app, which you can either verify or deny. Mobile app code	This method also uses the Authenticator app, and you install and register it in the same way. Enter the code from the app. Email	Provide an email address that's external to Azure and Microsoft 365. Azure sends a code to the address, which you enter in the reset wizard. Mobile phone	Provide a mobile phone number. Azure sends a code to the phone in an SMS message, which you enter in the reset wizard. You can also choose to get an automated call. Office phone	Provide a nonmobile phone number. You receive an automated call to this number and press #.

Each method involves a registration process and a specific way of verification during the reset process."
"Require the minimum number of authentication methods
You can specify the minimum number of methods that the user must set up: one or two. For example, you might enable the mobile app code, email, office phone, and security questions methods and specify a minimum of two methods. Users can then choose the two methods they prefer, like mobile app code and email. For the security-question method, you can specify a minimum number of questions the user must set up to register for this method. You also can specify a minimum number of questions they must answer correctly to reset their password. After your users register the required information for the minimum number of methods you've specified, they're considered registered for SSPR. Recommendations
Enable two or more of the authentication reset request methods. Use the mobile app notification or code as the primary method, but also enable the email or office phone methods to support users without mobile devices. The mobile phone method isn't a recommended method, because it's possible to send fraudulent SMS messages. The security-question option is the least recommended method, because the answers to the security questions might be known to other people. Only use the security-question method in combination with at least one other method. Accounts associated with administrator roles
A strong, two-method authentication policy is always applied to accounts with an administrator role, regardless of your configuration for other users. The security-question method isn't available to accounts associated with an administrator role. Configure notifications
Administrators can choose how users are notified of password changes. There are two options you can enable:

Notify users on password resets: The user who resets their own password is notified to their primary and secondary email addresses. If the reset was done by a malicious user, this notification alerts the user, who can take mitigation steps. Notify all admins when other admins reset their password: All administrators are notified when another administrator resets their password. License requirements
There are three editions of Microsoft Entra ID: free, Premium P1, and Premium P2. The password-reset functionality you can use depends on your edition. Any user who is signed in can change their password, regardless of the edition of Microsoft Entra ID. If you're not signed in and you've forgotten your password or your password has expired, you can use SSPR in Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2. It's also available with Microsoft 365 Apps for business or Microsoft 365.","What is the recommended minimum number of authentication methods for users to register for SSPR, and why?",It is recommended to enable two or more authentication reset request methods.

It should only be used in combination with at least one other method to enhance security."
"Require the minimum number of authentication methods
You can specify the minimum number of methods that the user must set up: one or two. For example, you might enable the mobile app code, email, office phone, and security questions methods and specify a minimum of two methods. Users can then choose the two methods they prefer, like mobile app code and email. For the security-question method, you can specify a minimum number of questions the user must set up to register for this method. You also can specify a minimum number of questions they must answer correctly to reset their password. After your users register the required information for the minimum number of methods you've specified, they're considered registered for SSPR. Recommendations
Enable two or more of the authentication reset request methods. Use the mobile app notification or code as the primary method, but also enable the email or office phone methods to support users without mobile devices. The mobile phone method isn't a recommended method, because it's possible to send fraudulent SMS messages. The security-question option is the least recommended method, because the answers to the security questions might be known to other people. Only use the security-question method in combination with at least one other method. Accounts associated with administrator roles
A strong, two-method authentication policy is always applied to accounts with an administrator role, regardless of your configuration for other users. The security-question method isn't available to accounts associated with an administrator role. Configure notifications
Administrators can choose how users are notified of password changes. There are two options you can enable:

Notify users on password resets: The user who resets their own password is notified to their primary and secondary email addresses. If the reset was done by a malicious user, this notification alerts the user, who can take mitigation steps. Notify all admins when other admins reset their password: All administrators are notified when another administrator resets their password. License requirements
There are three editions of Microsoft Entra ID: free, Premium P1, and Premium P2. The password-reset functionality you can use depends on your edition. Any user who is signed in can change their password, regardless of the edition of Microsoft Entra ID. If you're not signed in and you've forgotten your password or your password has expired, you can use SSPR in Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2. It's also available with Microsoft 365 Apps for business or Microsoft 365.","How are administrators notified of password changes, and what are the benefits of this notification system?","Administrators can configure notifications to alert users on password resets and notify all admins when other admins reset their password. This system helps users take mitigation steps if a reset was done maliciously and keeps administrators informed of changes, enhancing overall security."
"In a hybrid situation, where you have Active Directory on-premises and Microsoft Entra ID in the cloud, any password change in the cloud must be written back to the on-premises directory. This writeback support is available in Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2. It's also available with Microsoft 365 Apps for business. SSPR deployment options
You can deploy SSPR with password writeback by using Microsoft Entra Connect or cloud sync, depending on user needs. You can deploy each option side-by-side in different domains to target different sets of users. This helps existing users on-premises to write back password changes, while adding an option for users in disconnected domains because of a company merger or split. Users from an existing on-premises domain can use Microsoft Entra Connect, while new users from a merger can use cloud sync in another domain. Cloud sync can also provide higher availability, because it doesn't rely on a single instance of Microsoft Entra Connect. For a feature comparison between the two deployment options, see Comparison between Microsoft Entra Connect and cloud sync. Check your knowledge

2- Plan virtual networks

A major incentive for adopting cloud solutions like Azure is to enable information technology departments to transition server resources to the cloud. Moving resources to the cloud can save money and simplify administrative operations. Relocating resources removes the need to maintain expensive datacenters with uninterruptible power supplies, generators, multiple fail-safes, or clustered database servers. For small and medium-sized companies, which might not have the expertise to maintain their own robust infrastructure, moving to the cloud is particularly appealing. After resources are moved to Azure, they require the same networking functionality as an on-premises deployment. In specific scenarios, the resources require some level of network isolation. Azure network services offer a range of components with functionalities and capabilities, as shown in the following image:

3- Create subnets

Subnets provide a way for you to implement logical divisions within your virtual network. Your network can be segmented into subnets to help improve security, increase performance, and make it easier to manage. Things to know about subnets
There are certain conditions for the IP addresses in a virtual network when you apply segmentation with subnets. Each subnet contains a range of IP addresses that fall within the virtual network address space. The address range for a subnet must be unique within the address space for the virtual network. The range for one subnet can't overlap with other subnet IP address ranges in the same virtual network. The IP address space for a subnet must be specified by using CIDR notation.

Private IP address assignment
A private IP address is allocated from the address range of the virtual network subnet that a resource is deployed in. There are two options: dynamic and static. Dynamic: Azure assigns the next available unassigned or unreserved IP address in the subnet's address range. Dynamic assignment is the default allocation method. Suppose addresses 10.0.0.4 through 10.0.0.9 are already assigned to other resources. In this case, Azure assigns the address 10.0.0.10 to a new resource. Static: You select and assign any unassigned or unreserved IP address in the subnet's address range. Suppose a subnet's address range is 10.0.0.0/16, and addresses 10.0.0.4 through 10.0.0.9 are already assigned to other resources.

A private IP address is allocated from the address range of the virtual network subnet that a resource is deployed in. There are two options: dynamic and static. Dynamic: Azure assigns the next available unassigned or unreserved IP address in the subnet's address range. Dynamic assignment is the default allocation method. Suppose addresses 10.0.0.4 through 10.0.0.9 are already assigned to other resources. In this case, Azure assigns the address 10.0.0.10 to a new resource. Static: You select and assign any unassigned or unreserved IP address in the subnet's address range. Suppose a subnet's address range is 10.0.0.0/16, and addresses 10.0.0.4 through 10.0.0.9 are already assigned to other resources. In this scenario, you can assign any address between 10.0.0.10 and 10.0.255.254. Next unit: Interactive lab simulation

4- Determine network security group effective rules

Each network security group and its defined security rules are evaluated independently. Azure processes the conditions in each rule defined for each virtual machine in your configuration. For inbound traffic, Azure first processes network security group security rules for any associated subnets and then any associated network interfaces. For outbound traffic, the process is reversed. Azure first evaluates network security group security rules for any associated network interfaces followed by any associated subnets. For both the inbound and outbound evaluation process, Azure also checks how to apply the rules for intra-subnet traffic. How Azure ends up applying your defined security rules for a virtual machine determines the overall effectiveness of your rules. Things to know about effective security rules
Let's explore how network security group rules are defined and processed within a virtual network to yield the effective rules. Consider the following virtual network configuration that shows network security groups (NSGs) controlling traffic to virtual machines (VMs). The configuration requires security rules to manage network traffic to and from the internet over TCP port 80 via the network interface. Diagram that shows how network security group security rules control traffic to virtual machines. In this virtual network configuration, there are three subnets. Subnet 1 contains two virtual machines: VM 1 and VM 2. Subnet 2 and Subnet 3 each contain one virtual machine: VM 3 and VM 4, respectively.

Let's explore how network security group rules are defined and processed within a virtual network to yield the effective rules. Consider the following virtual network configuration that shows network security groups (NSGs) controlling traffic to virtual machines (VMs). The configuration requires security rules to manage network traffic to and from the internet over TCP port 80 via the network interface. Diagram that shows how network security group security rules control traffic to virtual machines. In this virtual network configuration, there are three subnets. Subnet 1 contains two virtual machines: VM 1 and VM 2. Subnet 2 and Subnet 3 each contain one virtual machine: VM 3 and VM 4, respectively. Each VM has a network interface card (NIC).",How are effective security rules determined for a virtual machine in Azure?,"Azure processes the conditions in each rule defined for each virtual machine, evaluating security rules for associated subnets and network interfaces. The order of processing differs for inbound and outbound traffic, and this evaluation determines the overall effectiveness of the security rules for a virtual machine."
"Azure evaluates each NSG configuration to determine the effective security rules:

Evaluation	Subnet NSG	NIC NSG	Inbound rules	Outbound rules
VM 1	Subnet 1
NSG 1	NIC
NSG 2	NSG 1 subnet rules have precedence over NSG 2 NIC rules	NSG 2 NIC rules have precedence over NSG 1 subnet rules

and all outbound traffic is allowed
Inbound traffic effective rules
Azure processes rules for inbound traffic for all VMs in the configuration. Azure identifies if the VMs are members of an NSG, and if they have an associated subnet or NIC. When an NSG is created, Azure creates the default security rule DenyAllInbound for the group. The default behavior is to deny all inbound traffic from the internet. If an NSG has a subnet or NIC, the rules for the subnet or NIC can override the default Azure security rules. NSG inbound rules for a subnet in a VM take precedence over NSG inbound rules for a NIC in the same VM. Outbound traffic effective rules
Azure processes rules for outbound traffic by first examining NSG associations for NICs in all VMs. When an NSG is created, Azure creates the default security rule AllowInternetOutbound for the group. The default behavior is to allow all outbound traffic to the internet. If an NSG has a subnet or NIC, the rules for the subnet or NIC can override the default Azure security rules. NSG outbound rules for a NIC in a VM take precedence over NSG outbound rules for a subnet in the same VM. Things to consider when creating effective rules

The implication is that all inbound and outbound traffic is allowed, as Azure's default rules permit all traffic in the absence of specific NSG rules."
"If you place your virtual machine within a subnet or utilize a network interface, you don't have to associate the subnet or NIC with a network security group. This approach allows all network traffic through the subnet or NIC according to the default Azure security rules. If you're not concerned about controlling traffic to your resource at a specific level, then don't associate your resource at that level to a network security group. Consider importance of allow rules. When you create a network security group, you must define an allow rule for both the subnet and network interface in the group to ensure traffic can get through. If you have a subnet or NIC in your network security group, you must define an allow rule at each level. Otherwise, the traffic is denied for any level that doesn't provide an allow rule definition. Consider intra-subnet traffic. The security rules for a network security group that's associated to a subnet can affect traffic between all virtual machines in the subnet. By default, Azure allows virtual machines in the same subnet to send traffic to each other (referred to as intra-subnet traffic). You can prohibit intra-subnet traffic by defining a rule in the network security group to deny all inbound and outbound traffic. This rule prevents all virtual machines in your subnet from communicating with each other. Consider rule priority. The security rules for a network security group are processed in priority order. To ensure a particular security rule is always processed, assign the lowest possible priority value to the rule. It's a good practice to leave gaps in your priority numbering, such as 100, 200, 300, and so. The gaps in the numbering allow you to add new rules without having to edit existing rules.

When you configure virtual network peering, you can choose to open or close the network security group rules between the virtual networks. Next unit: Create virtual network peering

4- Create virtual network peering

Azure Virtual Network peering can be configured for virtual networks by using PowerShell, the Azure CLI, and in the Azure portal. In this module, we review the steps to create the peering in the Azure portal for virtual networks deployed through Azure Resource Manager. Things to know about creating virtual network peering
There are a few points to review before we look at how to create the peering in the Azure portal. To implement virtual network peering, your Azure account must be assigned to the Network Contributor or Classic Network Contributor role. Alternatively, your Azure account can be assigned to a custom role that can complete the necessary peering actions. For details, see Permissions. To create a peering, you need two virtual networks. The second virtual network in the peering is referred to as the remote network. Initially, the virtual machines in your virtual networks can't communicate with each other. After the peering is established, the machines can communicate within the peered network based on your configuration settings. How to connect virtual networks across Azure regions with Azure Global VNet peering

How to check your peering status
In the Azure portal, you can check the connectivity status of the virtual networks in your virtual network peering. The status conditions depend on how your virtual networks are deployed. Important

Your peering isn't successfully established until both virtual networks in the peering have a status of Connected. For deployment with the Azure Resource Manager, the two primary status conditions are Initiated and Connected. For the classic deployment model, the Updating status condition is also used. When you create the initial peering to the second (remote) virtual network from the first virtual network, the peering status for the first virtual network is Initiated. When you create the subsequent peering from the second virtual network to the first virtual network, the peering status for both the first and remote virtual networks is Connected.",What are the primary status conditions for virtual network peering in the Azure Resource Manager deployment model?,"In the Azure Resource Manager deployment model, the primary status conditions for virtual network peering are Initiated and Connected."
"In the Azure portal, you can see the status for the first virtual network change from Initiated to Connected. Next unit: Extend peering with user-defined routes and service chaining

5- Extend peering with user-defined routes and service chaining

Virtual network peering is nontransitive. The communication capabilities in a peering are available to only the virtual networks and resources in the peering. Other mechanisms have to be used to enable traffic to and from resources and networks outside the private peering network. Suppose you have three virtual networks: A, B, and C. You establish virtual network peering between networks A and B, and also between networks B and C. You don't set up peering between networks A and C. The virtual network peering capabilities that you set up between networks B and C don't automatically enable peering communication capabilities between networks A and C.

Things to know about extending peering
There are a few ways to extend the capabilities of your peering for resources and virtual networks outside your peering network:

Hub and spoke networks
User-defined routes
Service chaining
You can implement these mechanisms and create a multi-level hub and spoke architecture. These options can help overcome the limit on the number of virtual network peerings per virtual network. The following diagram shows a hub and spoke virtual network with an NVA and VPN gateway. The hub and spoke network is accessible to other virtual networks via user-defined routes and service chaining. Diagram that shows a hub virtual network with an NVA and VPN gateway that are accessible to other virtual networks. Mechanism	Description
Hub and spoke network	When you deploy a hub-and-spoke network, the hub virtual network can host infrastructure components like a network virtual appliance (NVA) or Azure VPN gateway. All the spoke virtual networks can then peer with the hub virtual network. Traffic can flow through NVAs or VPN gateways in the hub virtual network. User-defined route (UDR)	Virtual network peering enables the next hop in a user-defined route to be the IP address of a virtual machine in the peered virtual network, or a VPN gateway. Service chaining	Service chaining is used to direct traffic from one virtual network to a virtual appliance or gateway. A user-defined route defines the peered networks.

2- Review system routes

Azure uses system routes to direct network traffic between virtual machines, on-premises networks, and the internet. Information about the system routes is recorded in a route table. Things to know about system routes
Let's take a closer look at how Azure implements system routes. Azure uses system routes to control traffic for virtual machines in several scenarios:

Traffic between virtual machines in the same subnet
Traffic between virtual machines in different subnets in the same virtual network
Traffic from virtual machines to the internet
A route table contains a set of rules (called routes) that specifies how packets should be routed in a virtual network. Route tables record information about the system routes, where the tables are associated to subnets. Each packet leaving a subnet is handled based on the associated route table. Packets are matched to routes by using the destination. The destination can be an IP address, a virtual network gateway, a virtual appliance, or the internet. When a matching route can't be found, the packet is dropped. Business scenario
Suppose you have a virtual network with two subnets. In this configuration, you can use Azure system routes to control communication between the subnets and between subnets and the internet. A front-end subnet can use a system route to access the internet. A back-end subnet can use a system route to access the front-end subnet. Both subnets access a route table. The following illustration highlights this scenario:

Let's examine the characteristics of user-defined routes. UDRs control network traffic by defining routes that specify the next hop of the traffic flow. The next hop can be one of the following targets:

Virtual network gateway
Virtual network

"Business scenario
Suppose you have a virtual machine that performs a network function like routing, firewalling, or WAN optimization. You want to direct certain subnet traffic to the NVA. To accomplish this configuration, you can place an NVA between subnets or between one subnet and the internet. The subnet can use a UDR to access the NVA and then the internet. The subnet can use another UDR and NVA to access the back-end subnet. The following illustration highlights this scenario:

Diagram that shows two subnets that use a UDR to access an NVA as described in the text. Next unit: Determine service endpoint uses

4- Determine service endpoint uses

A virtual network service endpoint provides the identity of your virtual network to the Azure service. After service endpoints are enabled in your virtual network, you can secure Azure service resources to your virtual network by adding a virtual network rule to the resources. Today, Azure service traffic from a virtual network uses public IP addresses as source IP addresses. With service endpoints, service traffic switches to use virtual network private addresses as the source IP addresses when accessing the Azure service from a virtual network.

6- Create back-end pools

Each load balancer has one or more back-end pools that are used for distributing traffic. The back-end pools contain the IP addresses of the virtual NICs that are connected to your load balancer. You configure these pool settings in the Azure portal. Screenshot that shows how to configure back-end pools in the Azure portal. Things to know about back-end pools
The SKU type that you select determines which endpoint configurations are supported for the pool along with the number of pool instances allowed. The Basic SKU allows up to 300 pools, and the Standard SKU allows up to 1,000 pools. When you configure the back-end pools, you can connect to availability sets, virtual machines, or Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets.",What factors should be considered when choosing a SKU type for configuring back-end pools in Azure Load Balancer?,"When choosing a SKU type for configuring back-end pools, consider the number of pool instances required and the supported endpoint configurations. The Basic SKU allows up to 300 pools, whereas the Standard SKU supports up to 1,000 pools. Additionally, the Standard SKU supports a wider range of configurations, such as availability sets, virtual machines, and Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets."
"For the Basic SKU, you can select virtual machines in a single availability set or virtual machines in an instance of Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets. For the Standard SKU, you can select virtual machines or Virtual Machine Scale Sets in a single virtual network. Your configuration can include a combination of virtual machines, availability sets, and Virtual Machine Scale Sets. Next unit: Create health probes

7- Create health probes

A health probe allows your load balancer to monitor the status of your application. The probe dynamically adds or removes virtual machines from your load balancer rotation based on the machine response to health checks. When a probe fails to respond, the load balancer stops sending new connections to the unhealthy instance. The following image shows how to create a health probe in the Azure portal. A custom HTTP health probe is configured to run on TCP port 80. The probe is defined to check the health of the virtual machine instances at 5-second intervals. Screenshot that shows how to create a health probe in the Azure portal. Things to know about health probes
There are two main ways to configure a custom health probe: HTTP and TCP. In an HTTP probe, the load balancer probes your back-end pool endpoints every 15 seconds. A virtual machine instance is considered healthy if it responds with an HTTP 200 message within the specified timeout period (default is 31 seconds). If any status other than HTTP 200 is returned, the instance is considered unhealthy, and the probe fails. A TCP probe relies on establishing a successful TCP session to a defined probe port. If the specified listener on the virtual machine exists, the probe succeeds. If the connection is refused, the probe fails. To configure a probe, you specify values for the following settings:

Port: Back-end port
URI: URI for requesting the health status from the backend
Interval: Amount of time between probe attempts (default is 15 seconds)
Unhealthy threshold: Number of failures that must occur for the instance to be considered unhealthy
A Guest agent probe is a third option that uses the guest agent inside the virtual machine. This option isn't recommended when an HTTP or TCP custom probe configuration is possible. Next unit: Create load balancer rules


8- Create load balancer rules

You can define load-balancing rules to specify how traffic is distributed to your back-end pools. Each rule maps a front-end IP address and port combination to a set of back-end IP address and port combinations. Screenshot that shows how to create load-balancing rules in the Azure portal.",What is the difference between the Basic SKU and the Standard SKU in Azure Virtual Machine configurations?,"The Basic SKU allows selecting virtual machines in a single availability set or an instance of Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets, while the Standard SKU permits selecting virtual machines or Virtual Machine Scale Sets within a single virtual network. The configuration can include a combination of virtual machines, availability sets, and Virtual Machine Scale Sets."

"Things to know about load-balancing rules
Let's take a closer look at how to configure load-balancing rules for your back-end pools. To configure a load-balancing rule, you need to have a frontend, backend, and health probe for your load balancer. To define a rule in the Azure portal, you configure several settings:

IP version (IPv4 or IPv6)
Front-end IP address, *Port, and Protocol (TCP or UDP)
Back-end pool and Back-end port
Health probe
Session persistence
By default, Azure Load Balancer distributes network traffic equally among multiple virtual machines. Azure Load Balancer uses a five-tuple hash to map traffic to available servers. The tuple consists of the source IP address, source port, destination IP address, destination port, and protocol type. The load balancer provides stickiness only within a transport session. Session persistence specifies how to handle traffic from a client. By default, successive requests from a client go to any virtual machine in your pool. You can modify the session persistence behavior as follows:

None (default): Any virtual machine can handle the request. Client IP: Successive requests from the same client IP address go to the same virtual machine. Client IP and protocol: Successive requests from the same client IP address and protocol combination go to the same virtual machine. Note

Maintaining session persistence information is important for applications that implement a shopping cart. Can you think of other applications that might benefit from session persistence? Load-balancing rules can be used in combination with NAT rules. Consider a scenario where you use NAT from a load balancer's public address to TCP port 3389 on a specific virtual machine. By combining your NAT rule with load-balancing rules, you can enable remote desktop access from outside of Azure. Next unit: Interactive lab simulation

Azure Application Gateway is a load balancer for web traffic. Administrators implement an application gateway to manage traffic to their web apps. Suppose you work for the motor vehicle department of a governmental organization. The department runs several public websites that enable drivers to register their vehicles, and renew their licenses online. The vehicle registration website has been running on a single server, and has suffered multiple outages because of server failures. The outages have resulted in frustrated drivers trying to register their vehicles before their registrations expire. You're responsible for improving the resiliency of the site by adding multiple web servers to distribute the load. You want to centralize the site on a single load-balancing service, and simplify the URLs for site visitors. You're researching how to implement Azure Application Gateway. Learning objectives
In this module, you learn how to:

2- Implement Azure Application Gateway

Administrators use Azure Application Gateway to manage requests from client applications to their web apps. An application gateway listens for incoming traffic to web apps and checks for messages sent via protocols like HTTP. Gateway rules direct the traffic to resources in a back-end pool. Business scenario
Consider a scenario where internet client applications request access to resources in a load-balanced back-end pool. The requests can be managed by implementing Azure Application Gateway to listen for HTTP(S) messages. Messages can be handled by load-balancing rules to direct client request traffic to the appropriate resources in the pool. The following diagram illustrates this scenario:

Azure Application Gateway is a load balancer for web traffic. Administrators implement an application gateway to manage traffic to their web apps. Suppose you work for the motor vehicle department of a governmental organization. The department runs several public websites that enable drivers to register their vehicles, and renew their licenses online. The vehicle registration website has been running on a single server, and has suffered multiple outages because of server failures. The outages have resulted in frustrated drivers trying to register their vehicles before their registrations expire. You're responsible for improving the resiliency of the site by adding multiple web servers to distribute the load. You want to centralize the site on a single load-balancing service, and simplify the URLs for site visitors. You're researching how to implement Azure Application Gateway. Learning objectives

Clients send requests to your web apps by specifying the IP address or DNS name of your application gateway. Your gateway directs the requests to a selected web server in your back-end pool according to a set of rules. You define the rules for your gateway to identify the allowable routes for the request traffic. Things to know about traffic routing
Let's take a closer look at your routing options for Azure Application Gateway. Azure Application Gateway offers two primary methods for routing traffic:

Path-based routing sends requests with different URL paths to different pools of back-end servers. Multi-site routing configures more than one web application on the same application gateway instance. You can configure your application gateway to redirect traffic. Application Gateway can redirect traffic received at one listener to another listener, or to an external site. This approach is commonly used by web apps to automatically redirect HTTP requests to communicate via HTTPS. The redirection ensures all communication between your web app and clients occurs over an encrypted path. You can implement Application Gateway to rewrite HTTP headers. HTTP headers allow the client and server to pass parameter information with the request or the response. In this scenario, you can translate URLs or query string parameters, and modify request and response headers. Add conditions to ensure URLs or headers are rewritten only for certain conditions. Application Gateway allows you to create custom error pages instead of displaying default error pages. You can use your own branding and layout by using a custom error page. Path-based routing

"Consider a scenario where your web app receives requests for videos or images. You can use path-based routing to direct requests for the /video/\* path to a back-end pool of servers that are optimized to handle video streaming. Image requests for the /images/\* path can be directed to a pool of servers that handle image retrieval. The following illustration demonstrates this routing method:

Diagram that shows a path-based routing approach. Multi-site routing
When you need to support multiple web apps on the same application gateway instance, multi-site routing is the best option. Multi-site configurations are useful for supporting multi-tenant applications, where each tenant has its own set of virtual machines or other resources hosting a web application. In this configuration, you register multiple DNS names (CNAMEs) for the IP address of your application gateway and specify the name of each site. Application Gateway uses separate listeners to wait for requests for each site. Each listener passes the request to a different rule, which can route the requests to servers in a different back-end pool.

"The following flowchart demonstrates how the Application Gateway components work together to direct traffic requests between the frontend and back-end pools in your configuration. Flowchart that demonstrates how Application Gateway components direct traffic requests between the frontend and back-end pools. Front-end IP address
Client requests are received through your front-end IP address. Your application gateway can have a public or private IP address, or both. You can have only one public IP address and only one private IP address. Web Application Firewall (optional)
You can enable Azure Web Application Firewall for Azure Application Gateway to handle incoming requests before they reach your listener. The firewall checks each request for threats based on the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP). Common threats include SQL-injection, cross-site scripting, command injection, HTTP request smuggling and response splitting, and remote file inclusion. Other threats can come from bots, crawlers, scanners, and HTTP protocol violations and anomalies. OWASP defines a set of generic rules for detecting attacks. These rules are referred to as the Core Rule Set (CRS). The rule sets are under continuous review as attacks evolve in sophistication. Azure Web Application Firewall supports two rule sets: CRS 2.2.9 and CRS 3.0. CRS 3.0 is the default and more recent of these rule sets. If necessary, you can opt to select only specific rules in a rule set to target certain threats. Additionally, you can customize the firewall to specify which elements in a request to examine, and limit the size of messages to prevent massive uploads from overwhelming your servers. Listeners
Listeners accept traffic arriving on a specified combination of protocol, port, host, and IP address. Each listener routes requests to a back-end pool of servers according to your routing rules. A listener can be Basic or Multi-site. A Basic listener only routes a request based on the path in the URL. A Multi-site listener can also route requests by using the hostname element of the URL. Listeners also handle TLS/SSL certificates for securing your application between the user and Application Gateway. Routing rules
A routing rule binds your listeners to the back-end pools.

"Back-end pools
A back-end pool references a collection of web servers. You provide the IP address of each web server and the port on which it listens for requests when configuring the pool. Each pool can specify a fixed set of virtual machines, Virtual Machine Scale Sets, an app hosted by Azure App Services, or a collection of on-premises servers. Each back-end pool has an associated load balancer that distributes work across the pool. Health probes
Health probes determine which servers in your back-end pool are available for load-balancing. Application Gateway uses a health probe to send a request to a server. When the server returns an HTTP response with a status code between 200 and 399, the server is considered healthy. If you don't configure a health probe, Application Gateway creates a default probe that waits for 30 seconds before identifying a server as unavailable (unhealthy). Next unit: Knowledge check

Azure Application Gateway provides load balancing and application routing capabilities across multiple web sites. Several routing methods are available, including multi-site and path-based.",What load-balancing strategy does Azure Application Gateway use?,Azure Application Gateway implements a round-robin technique where requests are distributed to each available server in a back-end pool in turn.
"Back-end pools
A back-end pool references a collection of web servers. You provide the IP address of each web server and the port on which it listens for requests when configuring the pool. Each pool can specify a fixed set of virtual machines, Virtual Machine Scale Sets, an app hosted by Azure App Services, or a collection of on-premises servers. Each back-end pool has an associated load balancer that distributes work across the pool. Health probes
Health probes determine which servers in your back-end pool are available for load-balancing. Application Gateway uses a health probe to send a request to a server. When the server returns an HTTP response with a status code between 200 and 399, the server is considered healthy. If you don't configure a health probe, Application Gateway creates a default probe that waits for 30 seconds before identifying a server as unavailable (unhealthy). Next unit: Knowledge check

3- Public and private IP addressing in Azure

 You work for a manufacturing company, and you're moving resources into Azure. The database server must be accessible for clients in your on-premises network. Public resources—like web servers—must be accessible from the internet. You want to ensure that you plan IP addresses that support both these requirements. In this unit, you explore the constraints and limitations for public and private IP addresses in Azure.",Why is it important to check for IP address overlaps when integrating Azure with on-premises networks?,"It is important to check for IP address overlaps because if there is an overlap, you cannot route traffic between the on-premises network and the Azure network, preventing successful integration."
"Also, you look at the capabilities that are available in Azure to reassign IP addresses in your network. IP address types
In Azure, you can use two types of IP addresses:

Public IP addresses
Private IP addresses
You can allocate both types of IP addresses in one of two ways:

Dynamic
Static
Let's take a closer look at how the IP address types work together. Public IP addresses
Use a public IP address for public-facing services. A public address can be either static or dynamic. A public IP address can be assigned to a VM, an internet-facing load balancer, a VPN gateway, or an application gateway. Dynamic public IP addresses are assigned addresses that can change over the lifespan of the Azure resource. The dynamic IP address is allocated when you create or start a VM. The IP address is released when you stop or delete the VM. In each Azure region, public IP addresses are assigned from a unique pool of addresses. The default allocation method is dynamic. Static public IP addresses are assigned addresses that don't change over the lifespan of the Azure resource. To ensure that the IP address for the resource remains the same, you can set the allocation method to static. In this case, an IP address is assigned immediately, and is released only when you delete the resource or change the IP allocation method to dynamic. SKUs for public IP addresses
For public IP addresses, there are two SKUs from which to choose: Basic and Standard. All public IP addresses created before the introduction of SKUs are Basic SKU public IP addresses. With the introduction of SKUs, you can choose the scale, features, and pricing for load balancing internet traffic. Both Basic and Standard SKUs have:

A default inbound originated flow idle timeout of four minutes, which is adjustable to up to 30 minutes. A fixed outbound originated flow idle timeout of four minutes. Basic SKU
You can assign Basic public IPs by using static or dynamic allocation methods. You can assign Basic public IPs to any Azure resource that can be assigned a public IP address, including network interfaces, VPN gateways, application gateways, and internet-facing load balancers. By default, Basic SKU IP addresses:

Are open. Network security groups are recommended, but optional, for restricting inbound or outbound traffic. Are available for inbound only traffic. Are available when using instance meta data service (IMDS). Don't support Availability Zones. Don't support routing preferences. Standard SKU
By default, Standard SKU IP addresses:

Always use static allocation. Are secure, and thus closed to inbound traffic.","What are the two types of IP addresses available in Azure, and how can they be allocated?","In Azure, the two types of IP addresses are Public IP addresses and Private IP addresses. Both types can be allocated dynamically, where the address can change, or statically, where the address remains the same throughout the lifespan of the resource."

Are secure, and thus closed to inbound traffic.",How do Basic and Standard SKUs for public IP addresses differ in terms of security and allocation methods?,"Basic SKU IP addresses can be assigned using either static or dynamic allocation methods and are open by default, meaning network security groups are optional. Standard SKU IP addresses, on the other hand, always use static allocation and are secure by default, closed to inbound traffic."

Always use static allocation. Are secure, and thus closed to inbound traffic.",When and why would you choose a static public IP address over a dynamic one in Azure?,"You would choose a static public IP address when you need the IP address to remain constant throughout the lifespan of the Azure resource, such as for DNS settings or when the resource needs to be consistently accessible from the same address. Static IP addresses are assigned immediately and remain until you delete the resource or change the allocation method."
"You must enable inbound traffic by using a network security group. Are zone-redundant and optionally zonal (they can be created as zonal and guaranteed in a specific availability zone). Can be assigned to network interfaces, Standard public load balancers, application gateways, or VPN gateways. Can be utilized with the routing preference to enable more granular control of how traffic is routed between Azure and the Internet. Can be used as anycast frontend IPs for cross-region load balancers. For more information, see SKU comparison, Load Balancer overview, and components. Public IP address prefix
In Azure, a public IP address prefix is a reserved, static range of public IP addresses. Azure assigns an IP address from a pool of available addresses that's unique to each region in each Azure cloud. When you define a Public IP address prefix, associated public IP addresses are assigned from a pool for an Azure region. In a region with Availability Zones, Public IP address prefixes can be created as zone-redundant or associated with a specific availability zone. The benefit of a public IP address prefix is that you can specify firewall rules for a known range of IP addresses. If your business needs to have datacenters in different regions, you need a different public IP address range for each region. You can assign the addresses from a public IP address prefix to any Azure resource that supports public IP addresses. You can create a public IP address prefix by specifying a name and prefix size. The prefix size is the number of reserved addresses available for use. Public IP address prefixes consist of IPv4 or IPv6 addresses. You can use technology like Azure Traffic Manager to balance region-specific instances. You can only bring your own public IP addresses from on-premises networks into Azure by using a Custom IP address prefix. You can't specify addresses when you create a prefix; Azure assigns them. After a prefix is created, the IP addresses are fixed in a contiguous range. Public IP addresses can't be moved between regions; all IP addresses are region-specific. Private IP addresses
Private IP addresses are used for communication within an Azure Virtual Network, including virtual networks and your on-premises networks. You can set private IP addresses to dynamic (DHCP lease) or static (DHCP reservation). Dynamic private IP addresses are assigned through a DHCP lease and can change over the lifespan of the Azure resource. Static private IP addresses are assigned through a DHCP reservation and don't change throughout the lifespan of the Azure resource. Static private IP addresses persist if a resource is stopped or deallocated.",What is the primary purpose of using a network security group in Azure?,"The primary purpose of using a network security group in Azure is to enable inbound traffic control. They can be assigned to network interfaces, Standard public load balancers, application gateways, or VPN gateways to regulate and protect traffic flow."

"IP addressing for Azure virtual networks
In Azure, a virtual network is a fundamental component that acts as an organization's network. The administrator has full control over IP address assignment, security settings, and security rules. When you create a virtual network, you define a scope of IP addresses. Private IP addressing works the same way as it does in an on-premises network. You choose the private IP addresses that the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) reserves based on your network requirements:

10.0.0.0/8
172.16.0.0/12
192.168.0.0/16
A subnet is a range of IP address within the virtual network. You can divide a virtual network into multiple subnets. Each subnet must have a unique address range, which is specified in classless interdomain routing (CIDR) format. CIDR is a way to represent a block of network IP addresses. An IPv4 CIDR, specified as part of the IP address, shows the length of the network prefix. Consider, for example, CIDR 192.168.10.0/24. ""192.168.10.0"" is the network address, and ""24"" indicates that the first 24 bits are part of the network address, leaving the last 8 bits for specific host addresses. A subnet's address range can't overlap with other subnets in the virtual network or with the on-premises network. For all subnets in Azure, the first three IP addresses are reserved by default. For protocol conformance, the first and last IP addresses of all subnets also are reserved. In Azure, an internal DHCP service assigns and maintains the lease of IP addresses. The .1, .2, .3, and last IP addresses aren't visible or configurable by the Azure customer. These addresses are reserved and used by internal Azure services. In Azure virtual networks, IP addresses can be allocated to the following types of resources:

Virtual machine network interfaces
Load balancers
Application gateways

"Also, you asked them about their plans for expansion. Based on the results of this survey, you want to plan an IP addressing scheme that you won't have to change in the foreseeable future. In this unit, you explore the requirements for a network IP address scheme. You learn about classless inter-domain routing (CIDR) and how you can use it to slice an IP block to meet your addressing needs. In the next unit, there's an exercise that shows how to plan IP addressing for Azure virtual networks. Gather your requirements
Before planning your network IP address scheme, you must gather the requirements for your infrastructure. These requirements also will help you prepare for future growth by reserving extra IP addresses and subnets. Here are two of the questions you might ask to discover the requirements:

How many devices do you have on the network? How many devices are you planning to add to the network in the future? When your network expands, you don't want to redesign the IP address scheme. Here are some other questions you could ask:

Based on the services running on the infrastructure, what devices do you need to separate? How many subnets do you need? How many devices per subnet do you have? How many devices are you planning to add to the subnets in future? Are all subnets going to be the same size? How many subnets do you want or plan to add in future? You need to isolate some services. Isolating services provides another layer of security, but also requires good planning. For example, public devices can access your front-end servers, but the back-end servers need to be isolated. Subnets help isolate the network in Azure. However, all subnets within a virtual network can communicate with each other in Azure by default. To provide further isolation, you can use a network security group. You might isolate services depending on the data and its security requirements. For example, you might choose to isolate HR data and the company's financial data from customer databases. When you know the requirements, you have a greater understanding of the total number of devices on the network per subnet and how many subnets you need. CIDR allows more flexible allocation of IP addresses than was possible with the original system of IP address classes.

It can be achieved in Azure by using subnets to separate different services and implementing network security groups to control traffic between subnets. This helps in protecting sensitive data, such as HR or financial data, from unauthorized access while allowing necessary communication between public and internal servers."
"Therefore, the number of possible addresses on an Azure subnet is (2^n)-5, where n represents the number of host bits. Next unit: Exercise - Design and implement IP addressing for Azure virtual networks

5- Exercise - Design and implement IP addressing for Azure virtual networks

Now, you're ready to create and deploy some virtual networks with the IP addresses based on your design. In this unit, you deployed three virtual networks and subnets to support resources in those virtual networks. The CoreServicesVnet virtual network is deployed in the US West region. This virtual network has the largest number of resources. It has connectivity to on-premises networks through a VPN connection. This network has web services, databases, and other systems that are key to business operations. Shared services, such as domain controllers and DNS, are located here as well. A large amount of growth is anticipated, so a large address space is necessary for this virtual network. The ManufacturingVnet virtual network is deployed in the North Europe region, near the location of your organization's manufacturing facilities.

2- Connect services by using virtual network peering

You can use virtual network peering to directly connect Azure virtual networks together. When you use peering to connect virtual networks, virtual machines (VMs) in these networks can communicate with each other as if they're in the same network. With peered virtual networks, traffic between virtual machines is routed through the Azure network. The traffic uses only private IP addresses. It doesn't rely on internet connectivity, gateways, or encrypted connections. The traffic is always private, and it takes advantage of the high bandwidth and low latency of the Azure backbone network. A basic diagram of two virtual networks that are connected by virtual network peering. The two types of peering connections are created in the same way:

Virtual network peering connects virtual networks in the same Azure region, such as two virtual networks in North Europe. Global virtual network peering connects virtual networks that are in different Azure regions, such as a virtual network in North Europe and a virtual network in West Europe. Virtual network peering doesn't affect or disrupt any resources that you've already deployed to the virtual networks. When you use virtual network peering, consider the key features defined in the following sections. Reciprocal connections
When you create a virtual network peering connection with Azure PowerShell or Azure CLI, only one side of the peering gets created. To complete the virtual network peering configuration, you'll need to configure the peering in reverse direction to establish connectivity. When you create the virtual network peering connection through the Azure portal, the configuration for both side is completed at the same time. Think of how you'd connect two network switches together. You'd connect a cable to each switch and maybe configure some settings so that the switches can communicate. Virtual network peering requires similar connections in each virtual network. Reciprocal connections provide this functionality. Cross-subscription virtual network peering
You can use virtual network peering even when both virtual networks are in different subscriptions. This setup might be necessary for mergers and acquisitions, or to connect virtual networks in subscriptions that different departments manage.",What is virtual network peering and what are its use cases?,"Virtual network peering is a method to connect Azure virtual networks directly, allowing virtual machines in these networks to communicate as if they are in the same network. Use cases include enabling connectivity between networks in different departments or organizations, such as in mergers and acquisitions, and facilitating communication across different Azure regions or subscriptions without relying on internet connectivity."

This allows for cross-regional connectivity while maintaining the same benefits of private traffic and low latency."
"Virtual networks can be in different subscriptions, and the subscriptions can use the same or different Microsoft Entra tenants. When you use virtual network peering across subscriptions, you might find that an administrator of one subscription doesn't administer the peer network's subscription. The administrator might not be able to configure both ends of the connection. To peer the virtual networks when both subscriptions are in different Microsoft Entra tenants, the administrators of each subscription must grant the peer subscription's administrator the Network Contributor role on their virtual network. Transitivity
Virtual network peering is nontransitive. Only virtual networks that are directly peered can communicate with each other. Virtual networks can't communicate with peers of their peers. Suppose, for example, that your three virtual networks (A, B, C) are peered like this: A <-> B <-> C. Resources in A can't communicate with resources in C because that traffic can't transit through virtual network B. If you need communication between virtual network A and virtual network C, you must explicitly peer these two virtual networks. Gateway transit
You can connect to your on-premises network from a peered virtual network if you enable gateways transit from a virtual network that has a VPN gateway. Using gateway transit, you can enable on-premises connectivity without deploying virtual network gateways to all your virtual networks. This method can reduce the overall cost and complexity of your network. By using virtual network peering with gateway transit, you can configure a single virtual network as a hub network. Connect this hub network to your on-premises datacenter and share its virtual network gateway with peers. To enable gateway transit, configure the Allow gateway transit option in the hub virtual network where you deployed the gateway connection to your on-premises network. Also configure the Use remote gateways option in any spoke virtual networks. Note

If you want to enable the Use remote gateways option in a spoke network peering, you can't deploy a virtual network gateway in the spoke virtual network. Overlapping address spaces
IP address spaces of connected networks within Azure, between Azure and your on-premises network can't overlap. This is also true for peered virtual networks. Keep this rule in mind when you're planning your network design. In any networks you connect through virtual network peering, VPN, or ExpressRoute, assign different address spaces that don't overlap. Diagram of a comparison of overlapping and non-overlapping network addressing. Alternative connectivity methods
Virtual network peering is the least complex way to connect virtual networks together.",What is required for administrators to peer virtual networks across different Microsoft Entra tenants?,"To peer virtual networks across different Microsoft Entra tenants, administrators of each subscription must grant the peer subscription's administrator the Network Contributor role on their virtual network."

"Other methods focus primarily on connectivity between on-premises and Azure networks rather than connections between virtual networks. You can also connect virtual networks together through an ExpressRoute circuit. ExpressRoute is a dedicated, private connection between an on-premises datacenter and the Azure backbone network. The virtual networks that connect to an ExpressRoute circuit are part of the same routing domain and can communicate with each other. ExpressRoute connections don't go over the public internet, so your communications with Azure services are as secure as possible. VPNs use the internet to connect your on-premises datacenter to the Azure backbone through an encrypted tunnel. You can use a site-to-site configuration to connect virtual networks together through VPN gateways. VPN gateways have higher latency than virtual network peering setups. They're more complex and can cost more to manage. When virtual networks are connected through both a gateway and virtual network peering, traffic flows through the peering configuration. When to choose virtual network peering
Virtual network peering can be a great way to enable network connectivity between services that are in different virtual networks. Because it's easy to implement and deploy, and it works well across regions and subscriptions, virtual network peering should be your first choice when you need to integrate Azure virtual networks. Peering might not be your best option if you have existing VPN or ExpressRoute connections or services behind Azure Basic Load Balancers that would be accessed from a peered virtual network. In these cases, you should research alternatives. Next unit: Exercise - Prepare virtual networks for peering by using Azure CLI commands


3- Exercise - Prepare virtual networks for peering by using Azure CLI commands


Let's say your company is now ready to implement virtual network peering. You want to connect systems that are deployed in different virtual networks. To test this plan, you'll start by creating virtual networks to support the services your company is already running in Azure. You need three virtual networks:

The Sales virtual network is deployed in North Europe. Sales systems use this virtual network to process data that's added after a customer is engaged. The Sales team wants access to Marketing data.

Research systems use this virtual network.",What is the primary advantage of using ExpressRoute over a VPN for connecting an on-premises datacenter to Azure?,"The primary advantage of using ExpressRoute over a VPN is that ExpressRoute provides a dedicated, private connection that doesn't go over the public internet, making communications with Azure services more secure."
"Other methods focus primarily on connectivity between on-premises and Azure networks rather than connections between virtual networks. You can also connect virtual networks together through an ExpressRoute circuit. ExpressRoute is a dedicated, private connection between an on-premises datacenter and the Azure backbone network. The virtual networks that connect to an ExpressRoute circuit are part of the same routing domain and can communicate with each other. ExpressRoute connections don't go over the public internet, so your communications with Azure services are as secure as possible. VPNs use the internet to connect your on-premises datacenter to the Azure backbone through an encrypted tunnel. You can use a site-to-site configuration to connect virtual networks together through VPN gateways. VPN gateways have higher latency than virtual network peering setups. They're more complex and can cost more to manage. When virtual networks are connected through both a gateway and virtual network peering, traffic flows through the peering configuration. When to choose virtual network peering
Virtual network peering can be a great way to enable network connectivity between services that are in different virtual networks. Because it's easy to implement and deploy, and it works well across regions and subscriptions, virtual network peering should be your first choice when you need to integrate Azure virtual networks. Peering might not be your best option if you have existing VPN or ExpressRoute connections or services behind Azure Basic Load Balancers that would be accessed from a peered virtual network. In these cases, you should research alternatives. Next unit: Exercise - Prepare virtual networks for peering by using Azure CLI commands

Now that your peering connections are configured, let's take a look at how this affects the communication between VMs. Next unit: Exercise - Verify virtual network peering by using SSH between Azure virtual machines

5- Exercise - Verify virtual network peering by using SSH between Azure virtual machines

In the previous unit, you configured peering connections between the virtual networks to enable resources to communicate with each other. Your configuration used a hub and spoke topology. MarketingVNet was the hub, and SalesVNet and ResearchVNet were spokes. Diagram of a hub and spoke topology for virtual networks. Remember, peering connections are nontransitive. Intermediate virtual networks don't allow connectivity to flow through them to connected virtual networks. SalesVNet can communicate with MarketingVNet. ResearchVNet can communicate with MarketingVNet. MarketingVNet can communicate with both SalesVNet and ResearchVNet. The only communication that's not permitted is between SalesVNet and ResearchVNet. Even though SalesVNet and ResearchVNet are both connected to MarketingVNet, they can't communicate with each other because they're not directly peered to each other. Let's confirm the connectivity across the peering connections. To do this, you'll first create a connection from Azure Cloud Shell to a target VM's public IP address. Then you'll connect from the target VM to the destination VM by using the destination VM's private IP address. Important

To test the virtual network peering connection, connect to the private IP address assigned to each VM.",What steps are involved in verifying virtual network peering by using SSH between Azure virtual machines?,"To verify virtual network peering, you first create a connection from Azure Cloud Shell to a target VM's public IP address. Then, you connect from the target VM to the destination VM using the destination VM's private IP address. This process tests the connectivity across the peering connections."
"To connect to your VMs, you'll use SSH (Secure Shell) directly from Cloud Shell. When using SSH, you'll first find the public IP addresses that are assigned to your test VMs. In Cloud Shell, run the following command to list the IP addresses you'll use to connect to the VMs:

"In this unit, you'll learn what DNS is and how it works. You will also learn about Azure DNS and why you'd use it. What is DNS? DNS, or the Domain Name System, is a protocol within the TCP/IP standard. DNS serves an essential role of translating the human-readable domain names—for example: www.wideworldimports.com—into a known IP address. IP addresses enable computers and network devices to identify and route requests among themselves. DNS uses a global directory hosted on servers around the world. Microsoft is part of the network that provides a DNS service through Azure DNS. A DNS server is also known as a DNS name server, or just a name server. How does DNS work? A DNS server carries out one of two primary functions:

Maintains a local cache of recently accessed or used domain names and their IP addresses. This cache provides a faster response to a local domain lookup request. If the DNS server can't find the requested domain, it passes the request to another DNS server. This process repeats at each DNS server until either a match is made or the search times out. Maintains the key-value pair database of IP addresses and any host or subdomain over which the DNS server has authority. This function is often associated with mail, web, and other internet domain services. DNS server assignment
In order for a computer, server, or other network-enabled device to access web-based resources, it must reference a DNS server. When you connect by using your on-premises network, the DNS settings come from your server. When you connect by using an external location like a hotel, the DNS settings come from the internet service provider (ISP). Domain lookup requests
Here's a simplified overview of the process a DNS server uses when it resolves a domain-name lookup request:

Checks to see if the domain name is stored in the short-term cache. If so, the DNS server resolves the domain request. If the domain isn't in the cache, it contacts one or more DNS servers on the web to see if they have a match. When a match is found, the DNS server updates the local cache and resolves the request. If the domain isn't found after a reasonable number of DNS checks, the DNS server responds with a domain cannot be found error. IPv4 and IPv6
Every computer, server, or network-enabled device on your network has an IP address. An IP address is unique within your domain. There are two standards of IP address: IPv4 and IPv6.",What is the primary role of DNS in the TCP/IP standard?,"The primary role of DNS in the TCP/IP standard is to translate human-readable domain names into known IP addresses, enabling computers and network devices to identify and route requests among themselves."

"IPv4 is composed of four sets of numbers, in the range 0 to 255, each separated by a dot; for example: 127.0.0.1. Today, IPv4 is the most commonly used standard. Yet, with the increase in IoT devices, the IPv4 standard will eventually be unable to keep up. IPv6 is a relatively new standard and will eventually replace IPv4. It's made up of eight groups of hexadecimal numbers, each separated by a colon; for example: fe80:11a1:ac15:e9gf:e884:edb0:ddee:fea3. Many network devices are now provisioned with both an IPv4 and an IPv6 address. The DNS name server can resolve domain names to both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. DNS settings for your domain
Whether the DNS server for your domain is hosted by a third party or managed in-house, you'll need to configure it for each host type you're using. Host types include web, email, or other services you're using. As the administrator for your company, you want to set up a DNS server by using Azure DNS. In this instance, the DNS server will act as a start of authority (SOA) for your domain. DNS record types
Configuration information for your DNS server is stored as a file within a zone on your DNS server. Each file is called a record. The following record types are the most commonly created and used:

A is the host record, and is the most common type of DNS record. It maps the domain or host name to the IP address. CNAME is a Canonical Name record that's used to create an alias from one domain name to another domain name. If you had different domain names that all accessed the same website, you'd use CNAME. MX is the mail exchange record. It maps mail requests to your mail server, whether hosted on-premises or in the cloud. TXT is the text record. It's used to associate text strings with a domain name. Azure and Microsoft 365 use TXT records to verify domain ownership. Additionally, there are the following record types:

Wildcards
CAA (certificate authority)
NS (name server)
SOA (start of authority)
SPF (sender policy framework)

To host the domain name with Azure DNS, you first need to create a DNS zone for that domain.",What is the first step in hosting a domain with Azure DNS?,"The first step in hosting a domain with Azure DNS is to create a DNS zone for the domain in Azure. This involves linking the registered domain, such as wideworldimports.com, to the Azure DNS zone."
"A DNS zone holds all the DNS entries for your domain. When creating a DNS zone, you need to supply the following details:

Subscription: The subscription to be used. Resource group: The name of the resource group to hold your domains. If one doesn't exist, create one to allow for better control and management. Name: Your domain name, which in this case is wideworldimports.com. Resource group location: The location defaults to the location of the resource group. Screenshot of Create DNS zone page. Step 2: Get your Azure DNS name servers
After you create a DNS zone for the domain, you need to get the name server details from the name servers (NS) record. You use these details to update your domain registrar's information and point to the Azure DNS zone. Screenshot of the name server details on the DNS zone page. Step 3: Update the domain registrar setting
As the domain owner, you need to sign in to the domain-management application provided by your domain registrar. In the management application, edit the NS record and change the NS details to match your Azure DNS name server details. Changing the NS details is called domain delegation. When you delegate the domain, you must use all four name servers provided by Azure DNS. Step 4: Verify delegation of domain name services
The next step is to verify that the delegated domain now points to the Azure DNS zone you created for the domain. This process can take as few as 10 minutes, but might take longer. To verify the success of the domain delegation, query the start of authority (SOA) record. The SOA record is automatically created when the Azure DNS zone is set up. You can verify the SOA record using a tool like nslookup. The SOA record represents your domain and becomes the reference point when other DNS servers are searching for your domain on the internet. To verify the delegation, use nslookup like this:

dos

Copy
nslookup -type=SOA wideworldimports.com
Step 5: Configure your custom DNS settings
The domain name is wideworldimports.com. When it's used in a browser, the domain resolves to your website. But what if you want to add in web servers or load balancers? These resources need to have their own custom settings in the DNS zone, either as an A record or a CNAME. A record
Each A record requires the following details:

Name: The name of the custom domain, for example webserver1.","What is the purpose of creating a DNS zone for a domain, and what initial details are required to set it up?","The purpose of creating a DNS zone for a domain is to manage all the DNS entries associated with that domain. When setting up a DNS zone, you need to provide the subscription to be used, the name of the resource group (or create one if it doesn't exist), the domain name (e.g., wideworldimports.com), and the resource group location."
"A DNS zone holds all the DNS entries for your domain. When creating a DNS zone, you need to supply the following details:

Subscription: The subscription to be used. Resource group: The name of the resource group to hold your domains. If one doesn't exist, create one to allow for better control and management. Name: Your domain name, which in this case is wideworldimports.com. Resource group location: The location defaults to the location of the resource group. Screenshot of Create DNS zone page. Step 2: Get your Azure DNS name servers
After you create a DNS zone for the domain, you need to get the name server details from the name servers (NS) record. You use these details to update your domain registrar's information and point to the Azure DNS zone. Screenshot of the name server details on the DNS zone page. Step 3: Update the domain registrar setting
As the domain owner, you need to sign in to the domain-management application provided by your domain registrar. In the management application, edit the NS record and change the NS details to match your Azure DNS name server details. Changing the NS details is called domain delegation. When you delegate the domain, you must use all four name servers provided by Azure DNS. Step 4: Verify delegation of domain name services
The next step is to verify that the delegated domain now points to the Azure DNS zone you created for the domain. This process can take as few as 10 minutes, but might take longer. To verify the success of the domain delegation, query the start of authority (SOA) record. The SOA record is automatically created when the Azure DNS zone is set up. You can verify the SOA record using a tool like nslookup. The SOA record represents your domain and becomes the reference point when other DNS servers are searching for your domain on the internet. To verify the delegation, use nslookup like this:

You've now successfully delegated the domain from the domain registrar to your Azure DNS and configured an A record to link the domain to your web server. The next phase of the deployment is to improve resiliency by using a load balancer. Load balancers distribute inbound data requests and traffic across one or more servers. They reduce the load on any one server and improve performance. This technology is well established, you'll use it throughout your on-premises network. You know that the A record and CNAME record don't support direct connection to Azure resources like your load balancers. You've been tasked with finding out how to link the apex domain with a load balancer. What is an apex domain? The apex domain is your domain's highest level. In our case, that's wideworldimports.com. The apex domain is also sometimes referred to as the zone apex or root apex. It's often represented by the @ symbol in your DNS zone records. If you check the DNS zone for wideworldimports.com, you'll see there are two apex domain records: NS and SOA. The NS and SOA records are automatically created when you created the DNS zone. CNAME records that you might need for an Azure Traffic Manager profile or Azure Content Delivery Network endpoints aren't supported at the zone apex level. However, other alias records are supported at the zone apex level. What are alias records? Azure alias records enable a zone apex domain to reference other Azure resources from the DNS zone. You don't need to create complex redirection policies. You can also use an Azure alias to route all traffic through Traffic Manager. The Azure alias record can point to the following Azure resources:

A Traffic Manager profile
Azure Content Delivery Network endpoints
A public IP resource
A front-door profile
Alias records provide lifecycle tracking of target resources, ensuring that changes to any target resource are automatically applied to the DNS zone. Alias records also provide support for load-balanced applications in the zone apex. The alias record set supports the following DNS zone record types:

A: The IPv4 domain name-mapping record. AAAA: The IPv6 domain name-mapping record. CNAME: The alias for your domain, which links to the A record.",What is an apex domain and why is it important in DNS configuration?,"An apex domain is the highest level of a domain, often represented by the @ symbol in DNS zone records. It is important because it serves as the root of a domain's DNS configuration, and certain records like NS and SOA are automatically created for it when a DNS zone is set up. Apex domains are crucial for linking directly to resources like load balancers without needing complex redirection."

You've been tasked with finding out how to link the apex domain with a load balancer. What is an apex domain? The apex domain is your domain's highest level. In our case, that's wideworldimports.com. The apex domain is also sometimes referred to as the zone apex or root apex. It's often represented by the @ symbol in your DNS zone records. If you check the DNS zone for wideworldimports.com, you'll see there are two apex domain records: NS and SOA. The NS and SOA records are automatically created when you created the DNS zone. CNAME records that you might need for an Azure Traffic Manager profile or Azure Content Delivery Network endpoints aren't supported at the zone apex level. However, other alias records are supported at the zone apex level. What are alias records? Azure alias records enable a zone apex domain to reference other Azure resources from the DNS zone. You don't need to create complex redirection policies. You can also use an Azure alias to route all traffic through Traffic Manager. The Azure alias record can point to the following Azure resources:

A Traffic Manager profile
Azure Content Delivery Network endpoints
A public IP resource
A front-door profile
Alias records provide lifecycle tracking of target resources, ensuring that changes to any target resource are automatically applied to the DNS zone. Alias records also provide support for load-balanced applications in the zone apex. The alias record set supports the following DNS zone record types:

A: The IPv4 domain name-mapping record. AAAA: The IPv6 domain name-mapping record. CNAME: The alias for your domain, which links to the A record.",How do Azure alias records benefit DNS zone management compared to traditional A or CNAME records?,"Azure alias records allow a zone apex domain to reference Azure resources directly from the DNS zone, eliminating the need for complex redirection policies. They enable lifecycle tracking of target resources, automatically applying changes to the DNS zone based on updates to the resources. Alias records also support load-balanced applications at the zone apex, which is not possible with traditional A or CNAME records."

This flexibility allows for efficient traffic management and resource linkage at the DNS zone apex."
"Uses for alias records
The following are some of the advantages of using alias records:

Prevents dangling DNS records: A dangling DNS record occurs when the DNS zone records aren't up to date with changes to IP addresses. Alias records prevent dangling references by tightly coupling the lifecycle of a DNS record with an Azure resource. Updates DNS record set automatically when IP addresses change: When the underlying IP address of a resource, service, or application is changed, the alias record ensures that any associated DNS records are automatically refreshed. Hosts load-balanced applications at the zone apex: Alias records allow for zone apex resource routing to Traffic Manager. Points zone apex to Azure Content Delivery Network endpoints: With alias records, you can now directly reference your Azure Content Delivery Network instance. An alias record allows you to link the zone apex (wideworldimports.com) to a load balancer. It creates a link to the Azure resource rather than a direct IP-based connection.

As part of a remediation plan, the security team recommends adding network protections in the form of network virtual appliances. The cloud infrastructure team must ensure traffic gets properly routed through the virtual appliances and gets inspected for malicious activity. You'll learn about Azure routing, and you'll create custom routes to control the traffic flow. You'll also learn to redirect the traffic through the network virtual appliance so you can inspect the traffic before it's allowed through. Learning objectives

Next unit: Identify routing capabilities of an Azure virtual network

2- Identify routing capabilities of an Azure virtual network

To control traffic flow within your virtual network, you must learn the purpose and benefits of custom routes. You must also learn how to configure the routes to direct traffic flow through a network virtual appliance (NVA). Azure routing
Network traffic in Azure is automatically routed across Azure subnets, virtual networks, and on-premises networks. System routes control this routing. They're assigned by default to each subnet in a virtual network. With these system routes, any Azure virtual machine that is deployed into a virtual network can communicate with any other in the network. These virtual machines are also potentially accessible from on-premises through a hybrid network or the internet.",Why is it important to have knowledge of basic networking concepts before configuring Azure virtual networking?,"It is important to have knowledge of basic networking concepts, such as subnets and IP addressing, before configuring Azure virtual networking because these concepts are foundational for understanding how virtual networks operate. They enable you to effectively configure and manage routing, ensuring that traffic is properly directed and security measures are correctly implemented."
"You can't create or delete system routes, but you can override the system routes by adding custom routes to control traffic flow to the next hop. Every subnet has the following default system routes:

Address prefix	Next hop type
Unique to the virtual network	Virtual network
0.0.0.0/0	Internet
10.0.0.0/8	None
172.16.0.0/12	None
192.168.0.0/16	None
100.64.0.0/10	None
The Next hop type column shows the network path taken by traffic sent to each address prefix. The path can be one of the following hop types:

Virtual network: A route is created in the address prefix. The prefix represents each address range created at the virtual-network level. If multiple address ranges are specified, multiple routes are created for each address range. Internet: The default system route 0.0.0.0/0 routes any address range to the internet, unless you override Azure's default route with a custom route. None: Any traffic routed to this hop type is dropped and doesn't get routed outside the subnet. By default, the following IPv4 private-address prefixes are created: 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, and 192.168.0.0/16. The prefix 100.64.0.0/10 for a shared address space is also added. None of these address ranges are globally routable. The following diagram shows an overview of system routes and shows how traffic flows among subnets and the internet by default. You can see from the diagram that traffic flows freely among the two subnets and the internet. Diagram of traffic flowing among subnets and the internet. Within Azure, there are other system routes. Azure creates these routes if the following capabilities are enabled:

Virtual network peering
Service chaining
Virtual network gateway
Virtual network service endpoint
Virtual network peering and service chaining
Virtual network peering and service chaining let virtual networks within Azure be connected to one another. With this connection, virtual machines can communicate with each other within the same region or across regions. This communication in turn creates more routes within the default route table. Service chaining lets you override these routes by creating user-defined routes between peered networks. The following diagram shows two virtual networks with peering configured. The user-defined routes are configured to route traffic through an NVA or an Azure VPN gateway.","What are the default system routes for a subnet in a virtual network, and what is their significance?","The default system routes for a subnet include an address prefix unique to the virtual network with a next hop type of ""Virtual network,"" the 0.0.0.0/0 address prefix with a next hop type of ""Internet,"" and several private address prefixes (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16, 100.64.0.0/10) with a next hop type of ""None."" The significance of these routes is that they determine the default path for traffic flow, with ""None"" indicating that traffic is dropped, ""Internet"" indicating traffic is routed to the internet, and ""Virtual network"" allowing traffic within the virtual network."

"Diagram of virtual network peering with user-defined routes. Virtual network gateway
Use a virtual network gateway to send encrypted traffic between Azure and on-premises over the internet and to send encrypted traffic between Azure networks. A virtual network gateway contains routing tables and gateway services. Diagram of the structure of a virtual network gateway. Virtual network service endpoint
Virtual network endpoints extend your private address space in Azure by providing a direct connection to your Azure resources. This connection restricts the flow of traffic: your Azure virtual machines can access your storage account directly from the private address space and deny access from a public virtual machine. As you enable service endpoints, Azure creates routes in the route table to direct this traffic. Custom routes
System routes might make it easy for you to quickly get your environment up and running. However, there are many scenarios in which you want to more closely control the traffic flow within your network. For example, you might want to route traffic through an NVA or through a firewall. This control is possible with custom routes. You have two options for implementing custom routes: create a user-defined route, or use Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) to exchange routes between Azure and on-premises networks. User-defined routes
You can use a user-defined route to override the default system routes so traffic can be routed through firewalls or NVAs. For example, you might have a network with two subnets and want to add a virtual machine in the perimeter network to be used as a firewall. You can create a user-defined route so that traffic passes through the firewall and doesn't go directly between the subnets. When creating user-defined routes, you can specify these next hop types:

Virtual appliance: A virtual appliance is typically a firewall device used to analyze or filter traffic that is entering or leaving your network. You can specify the private IP address of a Network Interface Card (NIC) attached to a virtual machine so that IP forwarding can be enabled. Or you can provide the private IP address of an internal load balancer. Virtual network gateway: Use to indicate when you want routes for a specific address to be routed to a virtual network gateway. The virtual network gateway is specified as a VPN for the next hop type. Virtual network: Use to override the default system route within a virtual network. Internet: Use to route traffic to a specified address prefix that is routed to the internet. None: Use to drop traffic sent to a specified address prefix.",What is the purpose of a virtual network gateway in Azure?,A virtual network gateway in Azure is used to send encrypted traffic between Azure and on-premises over the internet and to send encrypted traffic between Azure networks.

Unlike system routes, which are automatically configured, user-defined routes offer more granular control, enabling scenarios where traffic must be routed through specific network devices or paths."
"With user-defined routes, you can't specify the next hop type VirtualNetworkServiceEndpoint, which indicates virtual network peering. Service tags for user-defined routes
You can specify a service tag as the address prefix for a user-defined route instead of an explicit IP range. A service tag represents a group of IP address prefixes from a given Azure service. Microsoft manages the address prefixes encompassed by the service tag and automatically updates the service tag as addresses change. Thus minimizing the complexity of frequent updates to user-defined routes and reducing the number of routes you need to create. Border gateway protocol
A network gateway in your on-premises network can exchange routes with a virtual network gateway in Azure by using BGP. BGP is the standard routing protocol that is normally used to exchange routing information among two or more networks. BGP is used to transfer data and information between autonomous systems on the internet, such as different host gateways. Typically, you use BGP to advertise on-premises routes to Azure when you're connected to an Azure datacenter through Azure ExpressRoute. You can also configure BGP if you connect to an Azure virtual network by using a VPN site-to-site connection. The following diagram shows a topology with paths that can pass data between Azure VPN Gateway and on-premises networks:

Diagram showing an example of using the Border Gateway Protocol. BGP offers network stability, because routers can quickly change connections to send packets if a connection path goes down. Route selection and priority
If multiple routes are available in a route table, Azure uses the route with the longest prefix match. For example, a message is sent to the IP address 10.0.0.2, but two routes are available with the 10.0.0.0/16 and 10.0.0.0/24 prefixes. Azure selects the route with the 10.0.0.0/24 prefix because it's more specific. The longer the route prefix, the shorter the list of IP addresses available through that prefix. When you use longer prefixes, the routing algorithm can select the intended address more quickly. You can't configure multiple user-defined routes with the same address prefix. If there are multiple routes with the same address prefix, Azure selects the route based on the type in the following order of priority:

"4- What is an NVA? A network virtual appliance (NVA) is a virtual appliance that consists of various layers like:

a firewall
a WAN optimizer
application-delivery controllers
routers
load balancers
IDS/IPS
proxies
You can deploy NVAs chosen from providers in Azure Marketplace. Such providers include Cisco, Check Point, Barracuda, Sophos, WatchGuard, and SonicWall. You can use an NVA to filter traffic inbound to a virtual network, to block malicious requests, and to block requests made from unexpected resources. In the retail-organization example scenario, you must work with the security and network teams. You want to implement a secure environment that scrutinizes all incoming traffic and blocks unauthorized traffic from passing on to the internal network. You also want to secure both virtual-machine networking and Azure-services networking as part of your company's network-security strategy. Your goal is to prevent unwanted or unsecured network traffic from reaching key systems. As part of the network-security strategy, you must control the flow of traffic within your virtual network.

With Azure Load Balancer, you can spread user requests across multiple virtual machines or other services, allowing you to scale the app to larger sizes than a single virtual machine can support and ensuring that users get service even when a virtual machine fails. In your healthcare organization, you can expect large user demand. It's vitally important that each user can book an appointment, even during peak demand or when one or more virtual machines fail. If you use multiple virtual servers for your front end and a load balancer to distribute traffic among them, you achieve a high capacity because all the virtual servers collaborate to satisfy requests. You also improve resilience because the load balancer can automatically reroute traffic when a virtual server fails. Here, you'll learn how Load Balancer's features can help you create robust app architectures. Distribute traffic with Azure Load Balancer
Azure Load Balancer is a service you can use to distribute traffic across multiple virtual machines. Use Load Balancer to scale applications and create high availability for your virtual machines and services. Load balancers use a hash-based distribution algorithm. By default, a five-tuple hash is used to map traffic to available servers. The hash is made from the following elements:

Source IP: The IP address of the requesting client. Source port: The port of the requesting client. Destination IP: The destination IP of the request. Destination port: The destination port of the request. Protocol type: The specified protocol type, TCP or UDP. Diagram showing an overview of Azure Load Balancer. Load Balancer supports inbound and outbound scenarios, provides low latency and high throughput, and scales up to millions of flows for TCP and UDP applications. Load balancers aren't physical instances. Load-balancer objects are used to express how Azure configures its infrastructure to meet your requirements.",What are the key features of Azure Load Balancer that make it suitable for building a resilient and scalable app architecture?,"Azure Load Balancer allows you to distribute user requests across multiple virtual machines or services, enabling you to scale your app beyond the capacity of a single virtual machine.

Azure Load Balancer helps by distributing traffic across multiple virtual servers, providing high capacity and resilience. It ensures that user requests are handled efficiently even if some virtual machines fail, thus maintaining service availability and reliability."
"With Load Balancer, you can use availability sets and availability zones to ensure that virtual machines are always available:

Configuration	Service level agreement (SLA)	Information
Availability set	99.95%	Protection from hardware failures within datacenters
Availability zone	99.99%	Protection from entire datacenter failure
Availability sets
An availability set is a logical grouping used to isolate virtual machine resources from each other when they're deployed. Azure ensures that the virtual machines you put in an availability set run across multiple physical servers, compute racks, storage units, and network switches. If there's a hardware or software failure, only a subset of your virtual machines is affected. Your overall solution stays operational. Availability sets are essential for building reliable cloud solutions. Diagram showing an overview of availability sets in Azure. Availability zones
An availability zone offers groups of one or more datacenters that have independent power, cooling, and networking. The virtual machines in an availability zone are placed in different physical locations within the same region. Use this architecture when you want to ensure that you can continue to serve users when an entire datacenter fail. Diagram showing an overview of availability zones in Azure. Availability zones don't support all virtual machine sizes and aren't available in all Azure regions. Check that they're supported in your region before you use them in your architecture. Select the right Load Balancer product
Two products are available when you create a load balancer in Azure: basic load balancers and standard load balancers. Basic load balancers allow:

Port forwarding
Automatic reconfiguration
Health probes
Outbound connections through source network address translation (SNAT)
Diagnostics through Azure Log Analytics for public-facing load balancers
You can only use basic load balancers with a single availability set or scale set. Standard load balancers support all of the basic load balancer features. They also allow:

HTTPS health probes
Availability zones
Diagnostics through Azure Monitor, for multidimensional metrics
High availability (HA) ports

2. What is the main advantage of an availability set? It allows virtual machines to be available across datacenter failures. It allows virtual machines to be available across physical server failures. It allows virtual machines to be grouped into logical categories. 3- Configure a public load balancer

As the solution architect for the healthcare portal, you need to distribute the load from the client browsers over the virtual machines in your web farm. You need to set up a load balancer and configure the virtual machines to be balanced. A public load balancer maps the public IP address and port number of incoming traffic to the private IP address and port number of a virtual machine in the back-end pool. The responses are then returned to the client. By applying load-balancing rules, you can distribute specific types of traffic across multiple virtual machines or services. Distribution modes
By default, Azure Load Balancer distributes network traffic equally among virtual machine instances. The following distribution modes are also possible if a different behavior is required:

Five-tuple hash: The default distribution mode for Load Balancer is a five-tuple hash. The tuple is composed of source IP, source port, destination IP, destination port, and protocol type. Because the source port is included in the hash and the source port changes for each session, clients might be directed to a different virtual machine for each session. Diagram showing how hash-based distribution works. Source IP affinity: This distribution mode is also known as session affinity or client IP affinity. To map traffic to the available servers, the source IP affinity mode uses a two-tuple hash (from the source IP address and destination IP address) or a three-tuple hash (from the source IP address, destination IP address, and protocol type).

"Choose a distribution mode
In the healthcare-portal example, imagine that a developer requirement of the presentation tier is to use in-memory sessions to store the signed-in user's profile as the user interacts with the portal. In this scenario, the load balancer must provide source IP affinity to maintain a user's session. The profile is stored only on the virtual machine to which the client first connects, because that IP address is directed to the same server. When you create the load-balancer endpoint, you must specify the distribution mode by using the following PowerShell example:

PowerShell

$lb = Get-AzLoadBalancer -Name MyLb -ResourceGroupName MyResourceGroup
$lb.LoadBalancingRules[0].LoadDistribution = 'sourceIp'
Set-AzLoadBalancer -LoadBalancer $lb

The default five-tuple hash in Load Balancer is incompatible with this service. If you want to use Load Balancer with your Remote Desktop servers, use source IP affinity. Load Balancer and media upload
Another use case for source IP affinity is media upload. In many implementations, a client initiates a session through a TCP protocol and connects to a destination IP address. This connection remains open throughout the upload to monitor progress, but the file is uploaded through a separate UDP protocol. With the five-tuple hash, the load balancer likely sends the TCP and UDP connections to different destination IP addresses and the upload won't finish successfully.

To allow the load balancer to monitor the healthcare portal's status, create a health probe. The health probe dynamically adds or removes virtual machines from the load-balancer rotation based on their response to health checks.",How does the load balancer improve the scalability and resiliency of the healthcare-portal web application?,"The load balancer improves the scalability and resiliency of the healthcare-portal web application by distributing incoming traffic across the virtual machines, dynamically adjusting to the health and performance of each machine, and ensuring that the application remains available even if one of the machines fails."
"You have two virtual machines (VMs) in an availability set to act as your healthcare-portal web application. Here, you create a load balancer resource and use it to distribute a load across the virtual machines. Deploy the patient portal web application
First, deploy your patient-portal application across two virtual machines in a single availability set. To save time, let's start by running a script to create this application. The script:

Creates a virtual network and network infrastructure for the virtual machines. Creates two virtual machines in this virtual network. To deploy the patient portal web application:

Run the following git clone command in Azure Cloud Shell. The command clones the repo that contains the source for the app and runs the setup script from GitHub. Then changes to the directory of the cloned repo. Bash

Copy
git clone https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-improve-app-scalability-resiliency-with-load-balancer.git
cd mslearn-improve-app-scalability-resiliency-with-load-balancer
As its name suggests, the script generates two virtual machines in a single availability set. It takes about two minutes to run. Bash

Copy

5- Internal load balancer

In addition to balancing requests from users to front-end servers, you can use Azure Load Balancer to distribute traffic from front-end servers evenly among back-end servers. In your healthcare organization, front-end servers call business logic services hosted on a middle tier. You want to ensure that the middle tier is as scalable and resilient as the front end. You want to use a load balancer to distribute requests from the front-end servers evenly among the middle-tier servers. This way, you can scale out the middle-tier servers to achieve the highest capacity possible. You'll also ensure that the middle tier is resilient to failure. When a server fails, the load balancer automatically reroutes traffic to another server. Here, you learn how to use load balancers to distribute internal traffic. Configure an internal load balancer
In the healthcare-portal scenario, a web tier handles requests from users. The web tier connects to databases to retrieve data for users. The database tier is also deployed on two virtual machines. To allow the front-end web portal to continue to serve client requests if a database server fails, you can set up an internal load balancer to distribute traffic to the database servers. You can configure an internal load balancer in almost the same way as an external load balancer, but with these differences:

When you create the load balancer, select Internal for the Type value. When you select this setting, the load balancer's front-end IP address isn't exposed to the internet. Assign a private IP address instead of a public IP address for the load balancer's front end. Place the load balancer in the protected virtual network that contains the virtual machines you want to handle the requests. The internal load balancer should be visible only to the web tier. All the virtual machines that host the databases are in one subnet. You can use an internal load balancer to distribute traffic to those virtual machines. Diagram showing internal load balancer. Choose the distribution mode
In the healthcare portal, the application tier is stateless, so you don't need to use source IP affinity. You can use the default distribution mode of a five-tuple hash.

2- Implement Azure Storage

Azure Storage is Microsoft's cloud storage solution for modern data storage scenarios. Azure Storage offers a massively scalable object store for data objects. It provides a file system service for the cloud, a messaging store for reliable messaging, and a NoSQL store. Azure Storage is a service that you can use to store files, messages, tables, and other types of information. You use Azure Storage for applications like file shares. Developers use Azure Storage for working data. Working data includes websites, mobile apps, and desktop applications. Azure Storage is also used by IaaS virtual machines, and PaaS cloud services. Things to know about Azure Storage
You can think of Azure Storage as supporting three categories of data: structured data, unstructured data, and virtual machine data. Review the following categories and think about which types of storage are used in your organization.",What are the prerequisites for understanding and implementing Azure Storage configurations?,"The prerequisites include experience with the Azure portal and familiarity with managing different types of data storage. This knowledge helps prepare individuals for effectively configuring and managing Azure storage accounts, as well as for Exam AZ-104: Microsoft Azure Administrator."

3- Explore Azure Storage services

Azure Storage offers four data services that can be accessed by using an Azure storage account:

Azure Blob Storage (containers): A massively scalable object store for text and binary data. Azure Files: Managed file shares for cloud or on-premises deployments. Azure Queue Storage: A messaging store for reliable messaging between application components. Azure Table Storage: A service that stores nonrelational structured data (also known as structured NoSQL data). Let's examine the details of these services. Azure Blob Storage (containers)
Azure Blob Storage is Microsoft's object storage solution for the cloud. Blob Storage is optimized for storing massive amounts of unstructured or nonrelational data, such as text or binary data. Blob Storage is ideal for:

Serving images or documents directly to a browser. Storing files for distributed access. Streaming video and audio. Storing data for backup and restore, disaster recovery, and archiving. Storing data for analysis by an on-premises or Azure-hosted service. Objects in Blob Storage can be accessed from anywhere in the world via HTTP or HTTPS. Users or client applications can access blobs via URLs, the Azure Storage REST API, Azure PowerShell, the Azure CLI, or an Azure Storage client library. The storage client libraries are available for multiple languages, including .NET, Java, Node.js, Python, PHP, and Ruby. Note

You can access data from Azure Blob Storage by using the NFS protocol. Azure Files
Azure Files enables you to set up highly available network file shares. Shares can be accessed by using the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol and the Network File System (NFS) protocol. Multiple virtual machines can share the same files with both read and write access.",How does Azure Storage ensure secure access to data?,Azure Storage ensures secure access to data by encrypting all data and providing fine-grained control over who has access to the data.

"You can also read the files by using the REST interface or the storage client libraries. File shares can be used for many common scenarios:

Many on-premises applications use file shares. This feature makes it easier to migrate those applications that share data to Azure. If you mount the file share to the same drive letter that the on-premises application uses, the part of your application that accesses the file share should work with minimal, if any, changes. Configuration files can be stored on a file share and accessed from multiple virtual machines. Tools and utilities used by multiple developers in a group can be stored on a file share, ensuring that everybody can find them, and that they use the same version. Diagnostic logs, metrics, and crash dumps are just three examples of data that can be written to a file share and processed or analyzed later. The storage account credentials are used to provide authentication for access to the file share. All users who have the share mounted should have full read/write access to the share. Azure Queue Storage
Azure Queue Storage is used to store and retrieve messages. Queue messages can be up to 64 KB in size, and a queue can contain millions of messages. Queues are used to store lists of messages to be processed asynchronously. Consider a scenario where you want your customers to be able to upload pictures, and you want to create thumbnails for each picture. You could have your customer wait for you to create the thumbnails while uploading the pictures. An alternative is to use a queue. When the customer finishes the upload, you can write a message to the queue. Then you can use an Azure Function to retrieve the message from the queue and create the thumbnails. Each of the processing parts can be scaled separately, which gives you more control when tuning the configuration. Azure Table Storage
Azure Table storage is a service that stores non-relational structured data (also known as structured NoSQL data) in the cloud, providing a key/attribute store with a schemaless design. Because Table storage is schemaless, it's easy to adapt your data as the needs of your application evolve. Access to Table storage data is fast and cost-effective for many types of applications, and is typically lower in cost than traditional SQL for similar volumes of data. In addition to the existing Azure Table Storage service, there's a new Azure Cosmos DB Table API offering that provides throughput-optimized tables, global distribution, and automatic secondary indexes.",How can file shares in Azure facilitate the migration of on-premises applications?,"File shares in Azure can facilitate the migration of on-premises applications by allowing applications that use file shares to access data in the same way as they did on-premises.

"How to manage your storage account


Next unit: Determine replication strategies

5- Determine replication strategies

The data in your Azure storage account is always replicated to ensure durability and high availability. Azure Storage replication copies your data to protect from planned and unplanned events. These events range from transient hardware failures, network or power outages, massive natural disasters, and so on. You can choose to replicate your data within the same data center, across zonal data centers within the same region, and even across regions. Replication ensures your storage account meets the Service-Level Agreement (SLA) for Azure Storage even if there are failures. We explore four replication strategies:

Locally redundant storage (LRS)
Zone redundant storage (ZRS)
Geo-redundant storage (GRS)
Geo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS)
Locally redundant storage
Locally redundant storage is the lowest-cost replication option and offers the least durability compared to other strategies. If a data center-level disaster occurs, such as fire or flooding, all replicas might be lost or unrecoverable. Despite its limitations, LRS can be appropriate in several scenarios:

Your application stores data that can be easily reconstructed if data loss occurs. Your data is constantly changing like in a live feed, and storing the data isn't essential. Your application is restricted to replicating data only within a country/region due to data governance requirements. Zone redundant storage
Zone redundant storage synchronously replicates your data across three storage clusters in a single region. Each storage cluster is physically separated from the others and resides in its own availability zone.

5- Determine replication strategies

The data in your Azure storage account is always replicated to ensure durability and high availability. Azure Storage replication copies your data to protect from planned and unplanned events. These events range from transient hardware failures, network or power outages, massive natural disasters, and so on. You can choose to replicate your data within the same data center, across zonal data centers within the same region, and even across regions. Replication ensures your storage account meets the Service-Level Agreement (SLA) for Azure Storage even if there are failures. We explore four replication strategies:

Locally redundant storage (LRS)
Zone redundant storage (ZRS)
Geo-redundant storage (GRS)
Geo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS)
Locally redundant storage
Locally redundant storage is the lowest-cost replication option and offers the least durability compared to other strategies. If a data center-level disaster occurs, such as fire or flooding, all replicas might be lost or unrecoverable. Despite its limitations, LRS can be appropriate in several scenarios:

Your application stores data that can be easily reconstructed if data loss occurs. Your data is constantly changing like in a live feed, and storing the data isn't essential. Your application is restricted to replicating data only within a country/region due to data governance requirements. Zone redundant storage
Zone redundant storage synchronously replicates your data across three storage clusters in a single region. Each storage cluster is physically separated from the others and resides in its own availability zone. Each availability zone, and the ZRS cluster within it, is autonomous, and has separate utilities and networking capabilities. Storing your data in a ZRS account ensures you can access and manage your data if a zone becomes unavailable. ZRS provides excellent performance and low latency. ZRS isn't currently available in all regions. Changing to ZRS from another data replication option requires the physical data movement from a single storage stamp to multiple stamps within a region. Geo-redundant storage
Geo-redundant storage replicates your data to a secondary region (hundreds of miles away from the primary location of the source data). GRS provides a higher level of durability even during a regional outage. GRS is designed to provide at least 99.99999999999999% (16 9's) durability.",Why might an organization choose Geo-redundant Storage (GRS) over other replication strategies offered by Azure Storage?,"An organization might choose GRS because it replicates data to a secondary region, providing a higher level of durability during regional outages. GRS offers at least 99.99999999999999% durability, making it suitable for organizations that require high availability and data protection across different regions, ensuring business continuity even in the event of massive natural disasters."

"When your storage account has GRS enabled, your data is durable even when there's a complete regional outage or a disaster where the primary region isn't recoverable. If you implement GRS, you have two related options to choose from:

GRS replicates your data to another data center in a secondary region. The data is available to be read only if Microsoft initiates a failover from the primary to secondary region. Read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS) is based on GRS. RA-GRS replicates your data to another data center in a secondary region, and also provides you with the option to read from the secondary region. With RA-GRS, you can read from the secondary region regardless of whether Microsoft initiates a failover from the primary to the secondary. For a storage account with GRS or RA-GRS enabled, all data is first replicated with locally redundant storage. An update is first committed to the primary location and replicated by using LRS. The update is then replicated asynchronously to the secondary region by using GRS. Data in the secondary region uses LRS. Both the primary and secondary regions manage replicas across separate fault domains and upgrade domains within a storage scale unit. The storage scale unit is the basic replication unit within the datacenter. Replication at this level is provided by LRS. Geo-zone redundant storage
Geo-zone-redundant storage combines the high availability of zone-redundant storage with protection from regional outages as provided by geo-redundant storage. Data in a GZRS storage account is replicated across three Azure availability zones in the primary region, and also replicated to a secondary geographic region for protection from regional disasters. Each Azure region is paired with another region within the same geography, together making a regional pair. With a GZRS storage account, you can continue to read and write data if an availability zone becomes unavailable or is unrecoverable. Additionally, your data is also durable during a complete regional outage or during a disaster in which the primary region isn't recoverable. GZRS is designed to provide at least 99.99999999999999% (16 9's) durability of objects over a given year. GZRS also offers the same scalability targets as LRS, ZRS, GRS, or RA-GRS. You can optionally enable read access to data in the secondary region with read-access geo-zone-redundant storage (RA-GZRS).",What is the primary difference between GRS and RA-GRS in terms of data accessibility during a failover?,"The primary difference is that GRS allows data to be read from the secondary region only if Microsoft initiates a failover, whereas RA-GRS allows data to be read from the secondary region regardless of whether a failover has been initiated by Microsoft."

"If you map a custom domain and subdomain, such as www.contoso.com, to the blob or web endpoint for your storage account, your users can use that domain to access blob data in your storage account. Note

Azure Storage doesn't currently provide native support for HTTPS with custom domains. You can implement an Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) to access blobs by using custom domains over HTTPS. There are two ways to configure a custom domain: direct mapping and intermediary domain mapping. Direct mapping lets you enable a custom domain for a subdomain to an Azure storage account. For this approach, you create a CNAME record that points from the subdomain to the Azure storage account. The following example shows how a subdomain is mapped to an Azure storage account to create a CNAME record in the domain name system (DNS):

Subdomain: blobs.contoso.com
Azure storage account: \<storage account>\.blob.core.windows.net
Direct CNAME record: contosoblobs.blob.core.windows.net
Intermediary domain mapping is applied to a domain that's already in use within Azure. This approach might result in minor downtime while the domain is being mapped. To avoid downtime, you can use the asverify intermediary domain to validate the domain. By prepending the asverify keyword to your own subdomain, you permit Azure to recognize your custom domain without modifying the DNS record for the domain. After you modify the DNS record for the domain, your domain is mapped to the blob endpoint with no downtime. The following example shows how a domain in use is mapped to an Azure storage account in the DNS with the asverify intermediary domain:

Summary and resources

In this module, you learned about Azure Storage and how to create a storage account. The main takeaways from this module are:

Azure Storage provides a range of storage options for different types of data, including virtual machine data, unstructured data, and structured data. There are different types of storage accounts available, each with its own features and pricing model. It's important to consider the specific requirements of your application when choosing the right storage account type. Azure Storage offers four data services: Azure Blob Storage, Azure Files, Azure Queue Storage, and Azure Table Storage. Each service is optimized for different types of data and has its own use cases and benefits. Replication is an important consideration for ensuring data durability and high availability. Azure Storage offers different replication strategies to choose from based on your requirements.

5- Add blob lifecycle management rules

Every data set has a unique lifecycle. Early in the lifecycle, users tend to access some of the data in the set, but not all of the data. As the data set ages, access to all of the data in the set tends to dramatically reduce. Some data set stays idle in the cloud and is rarely accessed after it's stored. Some data expires within a few days or months after it's created. Other data is actively read and modified throughout the data set lifetime.

By selecting the correct access tier for your needs, you can store your blob data in the most cost-effective manner. Next unit: Add blob lifecycle management rules

5- Add blob lifecycle management rules

Every data set has a unique lifecycle. Early in the lifecycle, users tend to access some of the data in the set, but not all of the data. As the data set ages, access to all of the data in the set tends to dramatically reduce. Some data set stays idle in the cloud and is rarely accessed after it's stored. Some data expires within a few days or months after it's created. Other data is actively read and modified throughout the data set lifetime. Azure Blob Storage supports lifecycle management for data sets. It offers a rich rule-based policy for GPv2 and Blob Storage accounts.","What is the significance of lifecycle management in Azure Blob Storage, and how can it optimize storage costs?","Lifecycle management in Azure Blob Storage allows for rule-based policies to manage data sets over time. By configuring rules that automatically transition data between different access tiers based on its lifecycle, organizations can optimize storage costs by ensuring that data is stored in the most cost-effective tier as its access patterns change. This feature is particularly useful for data that is accessed frequently early on but becomes less accessed as it ages."
"You can use lifecycle policy rules to transition your data to the appropriate access tiers, and set expiration times for the end of a data set's lifecycle. How to automatically manage Azure Blobs lifecycles | Azure Tips and Tricks

Things to know about lifecycle management
You can use Azure Blob Storage lifecycle management policy rules to accomplish several tasks. Transition blobs to a cooler storage tier (Hot to Cool, Hot to Archive, Cool to Archive) to optimize for performance and cost. Delete blobs at the end of their lifecycles. Define rule-based conditions to run once per day at the Azure storage account level. Apply rule-based conditions to containers or a subset of blobs. Business scenario
Consider a scenario where data is frequently accessed in the early stages of the lifecycle, but only occasionally after two weeks. After the first month, the data set is rarely accessed. In this scenario, the Hot tier of Blob Storage is best during the early stages. Cool tier storage is most appropriate for occasional access. Archive tier storage is the best option after the data ages over a month. To achieve this transition, lifecycle management policy rules are available to move aging data to cooler tiers. Configure lifecycle management policy rules
In the Azure portal, you create lifecycle management policy rules for your Azure storage account by specifying several settings. For each rule, you create If - Then block conditions to transition or expire data based on your specifications. As you review these details, consider how you can set up lifecycle management policy rules for your data sets. Screenshot that shows how to add a lifecycle management policy rule for blob data in the Azure portal. If: The If clause sets the evaluation clause for the policy rule. When the If clause evaluates to true, the Then clause is executed. Use the If clause to set the time period to apply to the blob data. The lifecycle management feature checks if the data is accessed or modified according to the specified time. More than (days ago): The number of days to use in the evaluation condition. Then: The Then clause sets the action clause for the policy rule. When the If clause evaluates to true, the Then clause is executed.

Object replication copies blobs in a container asynchronously according to policy rules that you configure. During the replication process, the following contents are copied from the source container to the destination container:

The blob contents
The blob metadata and properties
Any versions of data associated with the blob
The following illustration shows an example of asynchronous replication of blob containers between regions. Diagram that shows asynchronous replication of blob containers between regions. Things to know about blob object replication
There are several considerations to keep in mind when planning your configuration for blob object replication. Object replication requires that blob versioning is enabled on both the source and destination accounts. Object replication doesn't support blob snapshots. Any snapshots on a blob in the source account aren't replicated to the destination account. Object replication is supported when the source and destination accounts are in the Hot, Cool, or Cold tier. The source and destination accounts can be in different tiers. When you configure object replication, you create a replication policy that specifies the source Azure storage account and the destination storage account. A replication policy includes one or more rules that specify a source container and a destination container. The policy identifies the blobs in the source container to replicate. Things to consider when configuring blob object replication
There are many benefits to using blob object replication. Consider the following scenarios and think about how replication can be a part of your Blob Storage strategy. Consider latency reductions. Minimize latency with blob object replication. You can reduce latency for read requests by enabling clients to consume data from a region that's in closer physical proximity. Consider efficiency for compute workloads. Improve efficiency for compute workloads by using blob object replication. With object replication, compute workloads can process the same sets of blobs in different regions. Consider data distribution. Optimize your configuration for data distribution. You can process or analyze data in a single location and then replicate only the results to other regions. Consider costs benefits.

"Things to know about blob types
Let's take a closer look at the characteristics of blob types. Block blobs. A block blob consists of blocks of data that are assembled to make a blob. Most Blob Storage scenarios use block blobs. Block blobs are ideal for storing text and binary data in the cloud, like files, images, and videos. Append blobs. An append blob is similar to a block blob because the append blob also consists of blocks of data. The blocks of data in an append blob are optimized for append operations. Append blobs are useful for logging scenarios, where the amount of data can increase as the logging operation continues. Page blobs. A page blob can be up to 8 TB in size. Page blobs are more efficient for frequent read/write operations. Azure Virtual Machines uses page blobs for operating system disks and data disks. The block blob type is the default type for a new blob. When you're creating a new blob, if you don't choose a specific type, the new blob is created as a block blob. After you create a blob, you can't change its type. Things to consider when using blob upload tools
A common approach for uploading blobs to your Azure storage account is to use Azure Storage Explorer. Many other tools are also available. Review the following options and consider which tools would suit your configuration needs. Upload tool	Description
AzCopy	An easy-to-use command-line tool for Windows and Linux. You can copy data to and from Blob Storage, across containers, and across storage accounts. Azure Data Box Disk	A service for transferring on-premises data to Blob Storage when large datasets or network constraints make uploading data over the wire unrealistic. You can use Azure Data Box Disk to request solid-state disks (SSDs) from Microsoft. You can copy your data to those disks and ship them back to Microsoft to be uploaded into Blob Storage.

3- Create shared access signatures

A shared access signature (SAS) is a uniform resource identifier (URI) that grants restricted access rights to Azure Storage resources. SAS is a secure way to share your storage resources without compromising your account keys. You can provide a SAS to clients who shouldn't have access to your storage account key. By distributing a SAS URI to these clients, you grant them access to a resource for a specified period of time. Things to know about shared access signatures
Let's review some characteristics of a SAS. A SAS gives you granular control over the type of access you grant to clients who have the SAS. An account-level SAS can delegate access to multiple Azure Storage services, such as blobs, files, queues, and tables. You can specify the time interval for which a SAS is valid, including the start time and the expiration time. You specify the permissions granted by the SAS. A SAS for a blob might grant read and write permissions to that blob, but not delete permissions. SAS provides account-level and service-level control. Account-level SAS delegates access to resources in one or more Azure Storage services. Service-level SAS delegates access to a resource in only one Azure Storage service. Note

A stored access policy can provide another level of control when you use a service-level SAS on the server side. You can group SASs and provide other restrictions by using a stored access policy. There are optional SAS configuration settings:

IP addresses. You can identify an IP address or range of IP addresses from which Azure Storage accepts the SAS. Configure this option to specify a range of IP addresses that belong to your organization. Protocols. You can specify the protocol over which Azure Storage accepts the SAS. Configure this option to restrict access to clients by using HTTPS. Configure a shared access signature

Task 5: Create and configure an Azure Files share.","In what scenarios might a SAS not be the best choice for accessing Azure storage, and what alternatives can be considered?","A SAS might not be the best choice when the risks associated with a specific operation outweigh the benefits. In such cases, a middle-tier service can be created to handle storage operations, performing business rule validation, authentication, and auditing. Alternatively, making a container public can be a simpler way to manage access if all blobs need to be publicly readable."
"Use a short-lived SAS to reduce this threat, but be mindful of clock skew on the end time. Validate data written by using a SAS	When a client application writes data to your Azure storage account, keep in mind there can be problems with the data. If your application requires validated or authorized data, validate the data after it's written, but before it's used. This practice also protects against corrupt or malicious data being written to your account, either by a user who properly acquired the SAS, or by a user exploiting a leaked SAS. Don't assume a SAS is always the correct choice	In some scenarios, the risks associated with a particular operation against your Azure storage account outweigh the benefits of using a SAS. For such operations, create a middle-tier service that writes to your storage account after performing business rule validation, authentication, and auditing. Also, sometimes it's easier to manage access in other ways. If you want to make all blobs in a container publicly readable, you can make the container Public, rather than providing a SAS to every client for access. Monitor your applications with Azure Storage Analytics	You can use logging and metrics to observe any spike in authentication failures. You might see spikes from an outage in your SAS provider service or to the inadvertent removal of a stored access policy. Next unit: Interactive lab simulation

3- Manage Azure file shares

Azure Files offers two industry-standard file system protocols for mounting Azure file shares: the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol and the Network File System (NFS) protocol. Azure file shares don't support both the SMB and NFS protocols on the same file share, although you can create SMB and NFS Azure file shares within the same storage account. Types of Azure file shares
Azure also offers two types of file shares: standard and premium. There are key differences between premium and standard file shares:

The premium tier stores data on modern solid-state drives (SSDs), while the standard tier uses hard disk drives (HDDs). Standard file shares can be used with SMB and REST protocols only, while premium file shares can be used with SMB, NFS, and REST protocols. You can easily switch between hot, cool, and transaction optimized tiers of standard file shares, but you can't switch from premium file shares to any of the standard tiers. Creating Azure SMB file shares
There are two important settings that you need to be aware of when creating and configuring SMB Azure file shares. Open port 445. Azure Files uses the SMB protocol. SMB communicates over TCP port 445. Be sure port 445 is open. Also, make sure your firewall isn't blocking TCP port 445 from the client machine. If you can't unblock port 445, then a VPN or ExpressRoute connection from on-premises to your Azure network is required, with Azure Files exposed on your internal network using private endpoints. Enable secure transfer. The Secure transfer required setting enhances the security of your storage account by limiting requests to your storage account from secure connections only. Consider the scenario where you use REST APIs to access your storage account. If you attempt to connect, and secure transfer required is enabled, you must connect by using HTTPS.",What are the main differences between Azure Files and Azure Blob Storage?,"Azure Files is ideal for applications that already use native file system APIs and require data sharing between apps, while Azure Blob Storage is suitable for streaming and random-access scenarios, allowing access to application data from anywhere."

Illustration of an Azure subscription showing some data services that cannot be placed in a storage account. Storage account settings
A storage account defines a policy that applies to all the storage services in the account. For example, you could specify that all the contained services will be stored in the West US datacenter, accessible only over https, and billed to the sales department's subscription. A storage account defines the following settings:

Subscription: The Azure subscription that's billed for the services in the account. Location: The datacenter that stores the services in the account. Performance: Determines the data services you can have in your storage account and the type of hardware disks used to store the data. Standard allows you to have any data service (Blob, File, Queue, Table) and uses magnetic disk drives. Premium provides more services for storing data. For example, storing unstructured object data as block blobs or append blobs, and specialized file storage used to store and create premium file shares. These storage accounts use solid-state drives (SSD) for storage. Replication: Determines the strategy used to make copies of your data to protect against hardware failure or natural disaster. At a minimum, Azure automatically maintains three copies of your data within the datacenter associated with the storage account. The minimum replication is called locally redundant storage (LRS), and guards against hardware failure but doesn't protect you from an event that incapacitates the entire datacenter.

The following illustration shows two storage accounts that differ in one setting; that one difference is enough to require separate storage accounts. Illustration showing two storage accounts with different settings. Typically, your data diversity, cost sensitivity, and tolerance for management overhead determine the number of storage accounts you need. Data diversity
Organizations often generate data that differs in where it's consumed, how sensitive it is, which group pays the bills, etc. Diversity along any of these vectors can lead to multiple storage accounts. Let's consider two examples:

Do you have data that is specific to a country/region? If so, you might want to store the data in a datacenter in that country/region for performance or compliance reasons. You need one storage account for each geographical region. Do you have some data that is proprietary and some for public consumption? If so, you could enable virtual networks for the proprietary data and not for the public data. Separating proprietary data and public data requires separate storage accounts. In general, increased diversity means an increased number of storage accounts. Cost sensitivity
A storage account by itself has no financial cost; however, the settings you choose for the account do influence the cost of services in the account. Geo-redundant storage costs more than locally redundant storage. Premium performance and the Hot access tier increase the cost of blobs. You can use multiple storage accounts to reduce costs. For example, you could partition your data into critical and noncritical categories.

Geo-redundant storage costs more than locally redundant storage. Premium performance and the Hot access tier increase the cost of blobs. You can use multiple storage accounts to reduce costs. For example, you could partition your data into critical and noncritical categories. You could place your critical data into a storage account with geo-redundant storage and put your noncritical data in a different storage account with locally redundant storage. Tolerance for management overhead
Each storage account requires some time and attention from an administrator to create and maintain.","Why might an organization need multiple storage accounts, and what factors influence this decision?","An organization might need multiple storage accounts due to data diversity, cost sensitivity, and tolerance for management overhead. Factors such as geographical data requirements, data sensitivity, cost management strategies, and administrative capabilities influence the number of storage accounts needed."
"It also increases complexity for anyone who adds data to your cloud storage. Everyone in an administrator role needs to understand the purpose of each storage account so they add new data to the correct account. Storage accounts are powerful tools to help you obtain the performance and security you need while minimizing costs. A typical strategy is to start with an analysis of your data. Create partitions that share characteristics like location, billing, and replication strategy. Then, create one storage account for each partition. Next unit: Choose your account settings

3- Choose your account settings

The storage account settings we've already covered apply to the data services in the account. Here, we discuss the three settings that apply to the account itself, rather than to the data stored in the account:

Name
Deployment model
Account kind
These settings affect how you manage your account and the cost of the services within it. Name
Each storage account has a name. The name must be globally unique within Azure, use only lowercase letters and digits and be between 3 and 24 characters. Deployment model
A deployment model is the system Azure uses to organize your resources. The model defines the API that you use to create, configure, and manage those resources. Azure provides two deployment models, Resource Manager and Classic. Resource Manager is the current model that uses the Azure Resource Manager API. The Classic model, which is currently being retired, was a legacy offering that used the classic deployment model. Most Azure resources only work with Resource Manager, which makes it easy to decide which model to choose. However, storage accounts, virtual machines, and virtual networks support both, so you must choose one or the other when you create your storage account. The key feature difference between the two models is their support for grouping. The Resource Manager model adds the concept of a resource group, which isn't available in the classic model. A resource group lets you deploy and manage a collection of resources as a single unit. Microsoft recommends that you use the Resource Manager deployment model for all new resources. Account kind
Storage account kind is a set of policies that determine which data services you can include in the account and the pricing of those services.",What are the key considerations when setting up a storage account in Azure?,"When setting up a storage account in Azure, you need to consider the name, deployment model, and account kind. The name must be globally unique, consist of lowercase letters and digits, and be between 3 and 24 characters. The deployment model involves choosing between Resource Manager and Classic, with the former being recommended for new resources due to its grouping capabilities. The account kind affects which data services are available and the pricing structure."

Additionally, Resource Manager is the current model recommended by Microsoft, as it supports more Azure resources and offers a more streamlined management experience."
"There are four kinds of storage accounts:

Standard - StorageV2 (general purpose v2): the current offering that supports all storage types and all of the latest features
Premium - Page blobs: Premium storage account type for page blobs only
Premium - Block blobs: Premium storage account type for block blobs and append blobs
Premium - File shares: Premium storage account type for file shares only

4- Choose an account creation tool

There are several tools that create a storage account. Your choice is typically based on if you want a GUI and whether you need automation. Available tools
The available tools are:

Azure portal
Azure CLI (Command-line interface)
Azure PowerShell
Management client libraries
The portal provides a GUI with explanations for each setting, which makes it easy to use and helpful for learning about the options. The other tools in this list all support automation. The Azure CLI and Azure PowerShell let you write scripts, while the management libraries allow you to incorporate the creation into a client app. How to choose a tool
Storage accounts are typically based on an analysis of your data, so they tend to be relatively stable. As a result, storage-account creation is usually a one-time operation done at the start of a project. For one-time activities, the portal is the most common choice. In the rare cases where you need automation, the decision is between a programmatic API or a scripting solution. Scripts are typically faster to create and less work to maintain because there's no need for an IDE, NuGet packages, or build steps. If you have an existing client application, the management libraries might be an attractive choice; otherwise, scripts are a better option.

1. Suppose you have two video files stored as blobs. One of the videos is business-critical and requires a replication policy that creates multiple copies across geographically diverse datacenters. The other video is noncritical, and a local replication policy is sufficient. Which of the following options would satisfy both data diversity and cost sensitivity consideration. Create a single storage account that makes use of Local-redundant storage (LRS) and host both videos from here.

2- Authorization options for Azure Storage

Before you enhance your company's patient diagnostic image web app, you'd like to understand all the options for secure access. A shared access signature (SAS) provides a secure way of granting access to resources for clients. But it's not the only way to grant access. In some situations, other options might offer better choices for your organization. Your company could make use of more than just the SAS method of authentication. In this unit, you look at the different ways to authenticate access to files stored in Azure Storage. Access Azure Storage
Clients access files stored in Azure Storage over HTTP/HTTPS. Azure checks each client request for authorization to access the stored data. Four options are available for accessing blob storage:

Public access
Microsoft Entra ID
Shared key
Shared access signature (SAS)
Public access
Public access is also known as anonymous public read access for containers and blobs. There are two separate settings that affect public access:

The Storage Account. Configure the storage account to allow public access by setting the AllowBlobPublicAccess property. When set to true, Blob data is available for public access only if the container's public access setting is also set. The Container.",What is a shared access signature (SAS) and how does it provide secure access to resources in Azure Storage?,"A shared access signature (SAS) is a secure way to delegate access to resources in your Azure Storage account. It allows you to provide clients with a URL that grants them specific permissions to access resources, such as blob storage, for a limited time. This ensures that only authorized users can access sensitive data, like patient diagnostic images, in a controlled manner."

The Container.",How does a stored access policy enhance the security and management of SAS in Azure Storage?,"A stored access policy enhances the security and management of SAS by allowing you to set shared access permissions at the container level. This policy can be used to control the lifetime and permissions of multiple SAS tokens, enabling you to easily revoke or update access without needing to regenerate individual SAS tokens. This provides a more manageable and secure way to control access to sensitive data."
"You can enable anonymous access only if anonymous access has been allowed for the storage account. A container has two possible settings for public access: Public read access for blobs, or public read access for a container and its blobs. Anonymous access is controlled at the container level, not for individual blobs. So, if you want to secure some of the files, you need to put them in a separate container that doesn't permit public read access. Both storage account and container settings are required to enable anonymous public access. The advantages of this approach are that you don't need to share keys with clients who need access to your files. You also don't need to manage a SAS. Microsoft Entra ID
Use the Microsoft Entra option to securely access Azure Storage without storing any credentials in your code. AD authorization takes a two-step approach. First, you authenticate a security principal that returns an OAuth 2.0 token if successful. This token is then passed to Azure Storage to enable authorization to the requested resource. Use this form of authentication if you're running an app with managed identities or using security principals. Shared key
Azure Storage creates two 512-bit access keys for every storage account that's created. You share these keys to grant clients access to the storage account. These keys grant anyone with access the equivalent of root access to your storage. We recommend that you manage storage keys with Azure Key Vault because it's easy to rotate keys on a regular schedule to keep your storage account secure. Shared access signature
A SAS lets you grant granular access to files in Azure Storage, such as read-only or read-write access, expiration time, after which the SAS no longer enables the client to access the chosen resources. A shared access signature is a key that grants permission to a storage resource, and should be protected in the same manner as an account key. Azure Storage supports three types of shared access signatures:

User delegation SAS: A user delegation SAS is secured with Microsoft Entra credentials, because the OAuth 2.0 token used to sign the SAS is requested on behalf of the user. It can only be used for Blob storage. Service SAS: A service SAS is secured using a storage account key. A service SAS delegates access to a resource in any one of four Azure Storage services: Blob, Queue, Table, or File. Account SAS: An account SAS is secured with a storage account key. An account SAS has the same controls as a service SAS, but can also control access to service-level operations, such as Get Service Stats.","What are the two possible settings for public access in a container, and how is anonymous access controlled?","A container can have two possible settings for public access: public read access for blobs or public read access for a container and its blobs. Anonymous access is controlled at the container level rather than for individual blobs. To secure certain files, they should be placed in a separate container that does not allow public read access."

"You can create a SAS ad-hoc by specifying all the options you need to control, including start time, expiration time, and permissions. If you plan to create a service SAS, there's also an option to associate it with a stored access policy. A stored access policy can be associated with up to five active SASs. You can control access and expiration at the stored access policy level. This approach is good if you need to have granular control to change the expiration, or to revoke a SAS.

A SAS has two components: a URI that points to one or more storage resources and a token that indicates how the client may access the resources.","How can a stored access policy enhance the management of SAS tokens, and what are the benefits of using it?","A stored access policy can be associated with up to five active SASs and allows for controlling access and expiration at the policy level. This approach provides granular control, making it easier to change expiration dates or revoke access without altering the storage account keys, which is the only way to change or revoke an ad-hoc SAS."
"You can create a SAS ad-hoc by specifying all the options you need to control, including start time, expiration time, and permissions. If you plan to create a service SAS, there's also an option to associate it with a stored access policy. A stored access policy can be associated with up to five active SASs. You can control access and expiration at the stored access policy level. This approach is good if you need to have granular control to change the expiration, or to revoke a SAS. The only way to revoke or change an ad-hoc SAS is to change the storage account keys. Check your knowledge

1. Your organization has an internal system to share patient appointment information and notes. You can secure a user's access based on their membership in a Microsoft Entra group. Which kind of authorization supports this scenario best, and why? Use a shared access signature (SAS) token. You use the Microsoft Entra credentials and a user delegation SAS token. Use Microsoft Entra ID. By using Microsoft Entra ID, you can create a service principal to authenticate the app. Use a shared key. The Azure Storage account can create and revoke keys that are used in your app. 2. Your public-facing static website stores all its public UI images in blob storage. The website needs to display the graphics without any kind of authorization. Which is the best option? Public access

Shared key

Shared access signature


3- Use shared access signatures to delegate access to Azure Storage

By using a shared access signature (SAS), you can delegate access to your resources. Clients don't have direct access to your storage account credentials and, at a granular level, you control what they access. After you investigate all the authorization options, you decide to look at a SAS in more detail. You want to create and use a SAS in a C# .NET web app. You also want to follow Microsoft's best practices on when and how to use a SAS.

To reduce the potential risks of using a SAS, Microsoft provides some guidance:

To securely distribute a SAS and help prevent man-in-the-middle attacks, always use HTTPS. The most secure SAS is user delegation.

A shared access signature (SAS) is a secure way to give access to clients without having to share your Azure credentials. This ease of use comes with a downside. Anyone with the correct SAS can access the file while it's still valid. The only way you can revoke access to the storage is to regenerate access keys. Regeneration requires you to update all apps that are using the old shared key to use the new one. Another option is to associate the SASs with a stored access policy.

"Network addresses and subnets aren't trivial to change after they're configured. If you plan to connect your private company network to the Azure services, make sure you consider the topology before you put any virtual machines into place. Virtual machine name
The virtual machine name is used as the computer name, which is configured as part of the operating system. You can specify a name with up to 15 characters on a Windows virtual machine and 64 characters on a Linux virtual machine. The virtual machine name also defines a manageable Azure resource, and it's not trivial to change later. You should choose names that are meaningful and consistent, so you can easily identify what the virtual machine does. A good convention uses several of the following elements in the machine name:

Name element	Examples	Description
Environment or purpose	dev (development), prod (production), QA (testing)	A portion of the name should identify the environment or purpose for the machine. Location	uw (US West), je (Japan East), ne (North Europe)	Another portion of the name should specify the region where the machine is deployed. Instance	1, 02, 005	For multiple machines that have similar names, include an instance number in the name to differentiate the machines in the same category. Product or service	Outlook, SQL, AzureAD	A portion of the name can specify the product, application, or service that the machine supports. Role	security, web, messaging	A portion of the name can specify what role the machine supports within the organization. Let's consider how to name the first development web server for your company that's hosted in the US South Central location.

"Each region has different hardware available, and some configurations aren't available in all regions. There are price differences between locations. To find the most cost-effective choice, check for your required configuration in different regions. Virtual machine size
Azure offers different memory and storage options for different virtual machine sizes. The best way to determine the appropriate machine size is to consider the type of workload your machine needs to run. Based on the workload, you can choose from a subset of available virtual machine sizes. Azure Storage
Azure Managed Disks handle Azure storage account creation and management in the background for you. You specify the disk size and the performance tier (Standard or Premium). Azure creates and manages the disk. As you add disks or scale the virtual machine up and down, you don't have to worry about the storage being used. Virtual machine pricing options
A subscription is billed two separate costs for every virtual machine: compute and storage. By separating these costs, you can scale them independently and only pay for what you need. Compute expenses are priced on a per-hour basis but billed on a per-minute basis. If the virtual machine is deployed for 55 minutes, you're charged for only 55 minutes of usage. You're not charged for compute capacity if you stop and deallocate the virtual machine. The hourly price varies based on the virtual machine size and operating system you select. For the compute costs, you're able to choose from two payment options:

Consumption-based: With the consumption-based option, you pay for compute capacity by the second. You're able to increase or decrease compute capacity on demand and start or stop at any time. Use consumption-based pricing if you run applications with short-term or unpredictable workloads that can't be interrupted. An example scenario is if you're doing a quick test or developing an app in a virtual machine. Reserved Virtual Machine Instances: The Reserved Virtual Machine Instances (RI) option is an advance purchase of a virtual machine for one or three years in a specified region. The commitment is made up front, and in return, you get up to 72% price savings compared to pay-as-you-go pricing. RIs are flexible and can easily be exchanged or returned for an early termination fee. Use this option if the virtual machine has to run continuously, or you need budget predictability, and you can commit to using the virtual machine for at least a year. Storage costs are charged separately for the Azure Storage used by the virtual machine. The status of the virtual machine has no relation to the Azure Storage charges that are incurred.",What factors should be considered when selecting the appropriate virtual machine size in Azure?,"The appropriate virtual machine size in Azure should be determined by the type of workload that the machine needs to run. Based on the workload, you can choose from a subset of available virtual machine sizes that offer different memory and storage options."

You're not charged for compute capacity if you stop and deallocate the virtual machine. The hourly price varies based on the virtual machine size and operating system you select. For the compute costs, you're able to choose from two payment options:

Consumption-based: With the consumption-based option, you pay for compute capacity by the second. You're able to increase or decrease compute capacity on demand and start or stop at any time. Use consumption-based pricing if you run applications with short-term or unpredictable workloads that can't be interrupted. An example scenario is if you're doing a quick test or developing an app in a virtual machine. Reserved Virtual Machine Instances: The Reserved Virtual Machine Instances (RI) option is an advance purchase of a virtual machine for one or three years in a specified region. The commitment is made up front, and in return, you get up to 72% price savings compared to pay-as-you-go pricing. RIs are flexible and can easily be exchanged or returned for an early termination fee. Use this option if the virtual machine has to run continuously, or you need budget predictability, and you can commit to using the virtual machine for at least a year. Storage costs are charged separately for the Azure Storage used by the virtual machine. The status of the virtual machine has no relation to the Azure Storage charges that are incurred.",What are the advantages of using Reserved Virtual Machine Instances (RI) in Azure?,"Reserved Virtual Machine Instances (RI) in Azure offer up to 72% price savings compared to pay-as-you-go pricing, providing budget predictability.

5- Determine virtual machine storage

Just like any other computer, virtual machines in Azure use disks as a place to store the operating system, applications, and data. Things to know about virtual machine storage and disks
All Azure virtual machines have at least two disks: an operating system disk and a temporary disk. Virtual machines can also have one or more data disks. All disks are stored as virtual hard disks (VHDs). A VHD is like a physical disk in an on-premises server but, virtualized. Diagram that shows disks used by an Azure virtual machine, including disks for the OS, data, and temporary storage. Operating system disk
Every virtual machine has one attached operating system disk. The OS disk has a pre-installed operating system, which is selected when the virtual machine is created. The OS disk is registered as a SATA drive (Serial Advanced Technology Attachment) and labeled as the C: drive by default. Temporary disk
Data on a temporary disk might be lost during a maintenance event or when you redeploy a virtual machine. During a standard reboot of the virtual machine, the data on the temporary drive should persist. However, there are cases where the data might not persist, such as moving to a new host. Therefore, any data on the temporary drive shouldn't be data that's critical to the system. On Windows virtual machines, the temporary disk is labeled as the D: drive by default. This drive is used for storing the pagefile.sys file. On Linux virtual machines, the temporary disk is typically /dev/sdb. This disk is formatted and mounted to /mnt by the Azure Linux Agent.

"This disk provides temporary storage for applications and processes and is intended to only store data like page or swap files. Data disks
A data disk is a managed disk that's attached to a virtual machine to store application data, or other data you need to keep. Data disks are registered as SCSI drives and are labeled with a letter you choose. The size of a virtual machine determines how many data disks you can attach and the type of storage you can use to host the data disks. Things to consider when choosing storage for your virtual machines
Review the following considerations about using Azure Storage and Azure Managed Disks with your virtual machines. Consider Azure Premium Storage. You can choose Premium Storage to gain high-performance, low-latency disk support for your virtual machines with input/output (I/O)-intensive workloads. Virtual machine disks that use Premium Storage store data on solid-state drives (SSDs). To take advantage of the speed and performance of premium storage disks, you can migrate existing virtual machine disks to Premium Storage. Consider multiple Storage disks. In Azure, you can attach several Premium Storage disks to a virtual machine. Using multiple disks gives your applications up to 256 TB of storage per virtual machine. With Premium Storage, your applications can achieve 80,000 I/O operations per second (IOPS) per virtual machine, and a disk throughput of up to 2,000 megabytes per second (MB/s) per virtual machine. Read operations completed with Premium Storage yield low latencies. Consider managed disks. An Azure-managed disk is a VHD. Azure-managed disks are stored as page blobs, which are a random IO storage object in Azure. The disk is described as managed because it's an abstraction over page blobs, blob containers, and Azure storage accounts. With managed disks, you provision the disk, and Azure takes care of the rest. When you choose to use Azure-managed disks with your workloads, Azure creates and manages the disk for you. The available types of disks are Ultra Solid State Drives (SSD), Premium SSD, Standard SSD, and Standard Hard Disk Drives (HDD). Note

Managed disks are required for the single instance virtual machine SLA. Consider migrating to Premium Storage. For the best performance for your application, we recommend that you migrate any virtual machine disk that requires high IOPS to Premium Storage.

Depending on your organization's security policies, you can reuse a single public-private key pair to access multiple Azure virtual machines and services. You don't need a separate pair of keys for each virtual machine or service you wish to access. The following image shows how to use the SSH protocol to connect to a Linux-based virtual machine in the Azure portal. Screenshot that shows how to use the SSH protocol to connect to a Linux-based virtual machine in the Azure portal. The public key is placed on your Linux virtual machine, or any other service that you wish to use with public-key cryptography. The private key remains on your local system. Important

Protect your private key. Don't share your private key. Your public key can be shared with anyone, but only you (or your local security infrastructure) should possess your private key. Next unit: Interactive lab simulation

2- Plan for maintenance and downtime

Azure Administrators must be prepared for planned and unplanned failures. Let's explore three scenarios that can lead to your Azure virtual machine being impacted. Things to know about maintenance planning
An availability plan for Azure virtual machines needs to include strategies for unplanned hardware maintenance, unexpected downtime, and planned maintenance. As you review the following scenarios, think about how these scenarios can affect the example company website. An unplanned hardware maintenance event occurs when the Azure platform predicts that the hardware or any platform component associated to a physical machine is about to fail. When the platform predicts a failure, it issues an unplanned hardware maintenance event. Azure uses Live Migration technology to migrate your virtual machines from the failing hardware to a healthy physical machine. Live Migration is a virtual machine preserving operation that only pauses the virtual machine for a short time, but performance might be reduced before or after the event. Unexpected downtime occurs when the hardware or the physical infrastructure for your virtual machine fails unexpectedly. Unexpected downtime can include local network failures, local disk failures, or other rack level failures. When detected, the Azure platform automatically migrates (heals) your virtual machine to a healthy physical machine in the same datacenter. During the healing procedure, virtual machines experience downtime (reboot) and in some cases loss of the temporary drive. Planned maintenance events are periodic updates made by Microsoft to the underlying Azure platform to improve overall reliability, performance, and security of the platform infrastructure that your virtual machines run on. Most of these updates are performed without any impact to your virtual machines or Cloud Services. Note

Microsoft doesn't automatically update your virtual machine operating system or other software. You have complete control and responsibility for those updates. However, the underlying software host and hardware are periodically patched to ensure reliability and high performance. Next unit: Create availability sets

An availability set is a logical feature you can use to ensure a group of related virtual machines are deployed together.",What role do availability sets play in managing virtual machine workloads in Azure?,"Availability sets are a logical feature used to ensure that a group of related virtual machines is deployed together. They help manage virtual machine workloads by distributing them across multiple fault domains and update domains, reducing the risk of simultaneous failures and downtime. This setup enhances the overall availability and reliability of applications running on Azure."
"The grouping helps to prevent a single point of failure from affecting all of your machines. The grouping ensures that not all of the machines are upgraded at the same time during a host operating system upgrade in the datacenter. Things to know about availability sets
Let's review some characteristics of availability sets. All virtual machines in an availability set should perform the identical set of functionalities. All virtual machines in an availability set should have the same software installed. Azure ensures that virtual machines in an availability set run across multiple physical servers, compute racks, storage units, and network switches. If a hardware or Azure software failure occurs, only a subset of the virtual machines in the availability set are affected. Your application stays up and continues to be available to your customers. You can create a virtual machine and an availability set at the same time. A virtual machine can only be added to an availability set when the virtual machine is created. To change the availability set for a virtual machine, you need to delete and then recreate the virtual machine. You can build availability sets by using the Azure portal, Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates, scripting, or API tools. Microsoft provides robust Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for Azure virtual machines and availability sets. For details, see SLA for Azure Virtual Machines. Note

Adding your virtual machines to an availability set won't protect your applications from operating system or application-specific failures. You'll need to explore other disaster recovery and backup techniques to provide application-level protection. Things to consider when using availability sets
Availability sets are an essential capability when you want to build reliable cloud solutions. In your planning for availability sets, keep the following general principles in mind:

Consider redundancy. To achieve redundancy in your configuration, place multiple virtual machines in an availability set. Consider separation of application tiers. Each application tier exercised in your configuration should be located in a separate availability set. The separation helps to mitigate single point of failure on all machines. Consider load balancing. For high availability and network performance, create a load-balanced availability set by using Azure Load Balancer. Load Balancer distributes incoming traffic across working instances of services that are defined in your load-balanced availability set. Consider managed disks. You can use Azure managed disks with your Azure virtual machines in availability sets for block-level storage. Next unit: Review update domains and fault domains


4- Review update domains and fault domains

Azure Virtual Machine Availability Sets implements two node concepts to help Azure maintain high availability and fault tolerance when deploying and upgrading applications: update domains and fault domains.","What is an availability set in Azure, and why is it important for cloud solutions?","An availability set in Azure is a logical grouping of virtual machines that helps to prevent a single point of failure from impacting all machines. It ensures that not all machines are upgraded simultaneously during a host operating system upgrade and distributes VMs across multiple physical servers, compute racks, storage units, and network switches. This is important for building reliable cloud solutions as it enhances high availability and fault tolerance."

Each application tier exercised in your configuration should be located in a separate availability set. The separation helps to mitigate single point of failure on all machines. Consider load balancing. For high availability and network performance, create a load-balanced availability set by using Azure Load Balancer. Load Balancer distributes incoming traffic across working instances of services that are defined in your load-balanced availability set. Consider managed disks. You can use Azure managed disks with your Azure virtual machines in availability sets for block-level storage. Next unit: Review update domains and fault domains


4- Review update domains and fault domains

Azure Virtual Machine Availability Sets implements two node concepts to help Azure maintain high availability and fault tolerance when deploying and upgrading applications: update domains and fault domains.",How does Azure ensure fault tolerance when deploying applications using availability sets?,"Azure ensures fault tolerance by running virtual machines in an availability set across multiple physical servers, compute racks, storage units, and network switches. This setup means that if there's a hardware or software failure, only a subset of the virtual machines in the availability set are affected, allowing the application to continue running and remain available to customers."
"The grouping helps to prevent a single point of failure from affecting all of your machines. The grouping ensures that not all of the machines are upgraded at the same time during a host operating system upgrade in the datacenter. Things to know about availability sets
Let's review some characteristics of availability sets. All virtual machines in an availability set should perform the identical set of functionalities. All virtual machines in an availability set should have the same software installed. Azure ensures that virtual machines in an availability set run across multiple physical servers, compute racks, storage units, and network switches. If a hardware or Azure software failure occurs, only a subset of the virtual machines in the availability set are affected. Your application stays up and continues to be available to your customers. You can create a virtual machine and an availability set at the same time. A virtual machine can only be added to an availability set when the virtual machine is created. To change the availability set for a virtual machine, you need to delete and then recreate the virtual machine. You can build availability sets by using the Azure portal, Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates, scripting, or API tools. Microsoft provides robust Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for Azure virtual machines and availability sets. For details, see SLA for Azure Virtual Machines. Note

Adding your virtual machines to an availability set won't protect your applications from operating system or application-specific failures. You'll need to explore other disaster recovery and backup techniques to provide application-level protection. Things to consider when using availability sets

These considerations help ensure robust cloud solutions and minimize downtime."
"Each virtual machine in an availability set is placed in one update domain and one fault domain. Things to know about update domains
An update domain is a group of nodes that are upgraded together during the process of a service upgrade (or rollout). An update domain allows Azure to perform incremental or rolling upgrades across a deployment. Here are some other characteristics of update domains. Each update domain contains a set of virtual machines and associated physical hardware that can be updated and rebooted at the same time. During planned maintenance, only one update domain is rebooted at a time. By default, there are five (non-user-configurable) update domains. You can configure up to 20 update domains. Things to know about fault domains
A fault domain is a group of nodes that represent a physical unit of failure. Think of a fault domain as nodes that belong to the same physical rack. A fault domain defines a group of virtual machines that share a common set of hardware (or switches) that share a single point of failure. An example is a server rack serviced by a set of power or networking switches. Two fault domains work together to mitigate against hardware failures, network outages, power interruptions, or software updates. Let's look at a scenario with two fault domains that have two virtual machines each. The virtual machines in each fault domain are contained in different availability sets. The web availability set contains two virtual machines with one machine from each fault domain. The SQL availability set contains two different virtual machines with one from each fault domain.

An availability zone in an Azure region is a combination of a fault domain and an update domain. Consider a scenario where you create three or more virtual machines across three zones in an Azure region. Your virtual machines are effectively distributed across three fault domains and three update domains. The Azure platform recognizes this distribution across update domains to make sure that virtual machines in different zones aren't updated at the same time.

6- Compare vertical and horizontal scaling

A robust virtual machine configuration includes support for scalability. Scalability allows throughput for a virtual machine in proportion to the availability of the associated hardware resources. A scalable virtual machine can handle increases in requests without adversely affecting response time and throughput. For most scaling operations, there are two implementation options: vertical and horizontal. Things to know about vertical scaling
Vertical scaling, also known as scale up and scale down, involves increasing or decreasing the virtual machine size in response to a workload. Vertical scaling makes a virtual machine more (scale up) or less (scale down) powerful. Illustration that shows vertical scaling where a single virtual machine increases or decreases in size by scaling up or scaling down. Here are some scenarios where using vertical scaling can be advantageous:

If you have a service built on a virtual machine that's under-utilized such as on the weekend, you can use vertical scaling to decrease the virtual machine size and reduce your monthly costs. You can implement vertical scaling to increase your virtual machine size to support larger demand without having to create extra virtual machines. Things to know about horizontal scaling
Horizontal scaling is used to adjust the number of virtual machines in your configuration to support the changing workload. When you implement horizontal scaling, there's an increase (scale out) or decrease (scale in) in the number of virtual machine instances. Illustration that shows horizontal scaling where virtual machines are added to scale out the system to support the workload.",What are availability zones and how do they ensure resiliency in cloud services?,"Availability zones are distinct locations within a cloud region, each with independent power, cooling, and networking.

"Things to consider when using vertical and horizontal scaling
Review the following considerations regarding vertical and horizontal scaling. Think about which implementation might be required to support your company website. Consider limitations. Generally speaking, horizontal scaling has fewer limitations than vertical scaling. A vertical scaling implementation depends on the availability of larger hardware, which quickly hits an upper limit and can vary by region. Vertical scaling also usually requires a virtual machine to stop and restart, which can temporarily limit access to applications or data. Consider flexibility. When operating in the cloud, horizontal scaling is more flexible. A horizontal scaling implementation allows you to run potentially thousands of virtual machines to manage changes in workload and throughput. Consider reprovisioning. Reprovisioning is the process of removing an existing virtual machine and replacing it with a new machine. A robust availability plan considers where reprovisioning might be required and plans for interruptions to service. If reprovisioning might be required, determine if any data needs to be maintained and migrated to the new machine. 7- Implement Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets

Image: Choose the base operating system or application for the virtual machine (VM). VM Architecture: Azure provides a choice of x64 or Arm64-based virtual machines to run your applications. Run with Azure Spot discount: Azure Spot offers unused Azure capacity at a discounted rate versus pay as you go prices. Workloads should be tolerant to infrastructure loss as Azure may recall capacity. Size: Select a VM size to support the workload that you want to run. The size that you choose then determines factors such as processing power, memory, and storage capacity. Azure offers a wide variety of sizes to support many types of uses. Azure charges an hourly price based on the VM's size and operating system. Under the Advanced tab, you can also select the following:

Enable scaling beyond 100 instances: Identify your scaling allocation preference. If you select No, your Virtual Machine Scale Sets implementation is limited to one placement group with a maximum capacity of 100. If you select Yes, your implementation can span multiple placement groups with capacity up to 1,000. Selecting Yes also changes the availability characteristics of your implementation. Spreading algorithm: Microsoft recommends allocating Max spreading for your implementation. This approach provides the optimal spreading. Next unit: Implement autoscale

9- Implement autoscale

An Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets implementation can automatically increase or decrease the number of virtual machine instances that run your application. This process is known as autoscaling. Autoscaling allows you to dynamically scale your configuration to meet changing workload demands.",What are the benefits of using Azure Spot instances in a Virtual Machine Scale Sets implementation?,"The benefits of using Azure Spot instances include accessing unused Azure capacity at a discounted rate compared to pay-as-you-go prices, which can reduce costs. However, workloads should be tolerant to infrastructure loss as Azure may recall capacity at any time."
"Illustration of a Virtual Machine Scale Sets implementation with a minimum of two virtual machines and a maximum of five machines that autoscale depending on workload demands. Autoscaling minimizes the number of unnecessary virtual machine instances that run your application when demand is low. Your customers continue to receive an acceptable level of performance as demand grows and more virtual machine instances are automatically added. Things to consider when using autoscaling
Review the following considerations about autoscaling. Think about how this process can benefit your company website implementation. Consider automatic adjusted capacity. You can create autoscaling rules to define the acceptable performance for a positive customer experience. When the defined thresholds are met, the autoscale rules act to adjust the capacity of your Virtual Machine Scale Sets implementation. Consider scale out.

2- Implement Azure App Service plans

In Azure App Service, an application runs in an Azure App Service plan. An App Service plan defines a set of compute resources for a web application to run. The compute resources are analogous to a server farm in conventional web hosting. One or more applications can be configured to run on the same computing resources (or in the same App Service plan). Things to know about App Service plans
Let's take a closer look at how to implement and use an App Service plan with your virtual machines. When you create an App Service plan in a region, a set of compute resources is created for the plan in the specified region. Any applications that you place into the plan run on the compute resources defined by the plan. Each App Service plan defines three settings:

Region: The region for the App Service plan, such as West US, Central India, North Europe, and so on. Number of VM instances: The number of virtual machine instances to allocate for the plan. Size of VM instances: The size of the virtual machine instances in the plan, including Small, Medium, or Large. You can continue to add new applications to an existing plan as long as the plan has enough resources to handle the increasing load.",What are the benefits of scaling an Azure App Service plan for a hotel website during varying seasonal demands?,"Scaling an Azure App Service plan allows the hotel website to efficiently handle fluctuations in traffic by allocating more resources during high-demand periods, such as holidays, and reducing resources when demand decreases. This approach not only ensures optimal performance and user experience but also helps save costs by not over-provisioning resources during low-traffic times."
"Scaling also helps to save money by reducing the resources required when demand drops. Suppose you work for a large chain of hotels. You're responsible for maintaining the hotel website. Customers visit the website to make new reservations and view details for their current bookings. At certain times of the year, the volume of website traffic grows because customers are browsing hotels for vacations during national/regional holidays. At other times, traffic declines. These website usage patterns are predictable. In this module, you learn to implementing Azure App Service plans. You learn how different App Service plans provide different pricing and scaling options. You learn how changing the plan affects performance. The goal of this module is to ensure you can determine the best App Service plan for your application. Learning objectives

"How applications run and scale in App Service plans
The Azure App Service plan is the scale unit of App Service applications. Depending on the pricing tier for your Azure App Service plan, your applications run and scale in a different manner. If your plan is configured to run five virtual machine instances, then all applications in the plan run on all five instances. If your plan is configured for autoscaling, then all applications in the plan are scaled out together based on the autoscale settings. Here's a summary of how applications run and scale in Azure App Service plan pricing tiers:

Free or Shared tier:

Applications run by receiving CPU minutes on a shared virtual machine instance. Applications can't scale out. Basic, Standard, Premium, or Isolated tier:

Applications run on all virtual machine instances configured in the App Service plan. Multiple applications in the same plan share the same virtual machine instances. If you have multiple deployment slots for an application, all deployment slots run on the same virtual machine instances. If you enable diagnostic logs, perform backups, or run WebJobs, these tasks use CPU cycles and memory on the same virtual machine instances. Things to consider when using App Service plans
Review the following considerations about using Azure App Service plans to run and scale your applications. Think about what conditions might apply to running and scaling the hotel website. Consider cost savings. Because you pay for the computing resources that your App Service plan allocates, you can potentially save money by placing multiple applications into the same App Service plan. Consider multiple applications in one plan. Create a single plan to support multiple applications, to make it easier to configure and maintain shared virtual machine instances. Because the applications share the same virtual machine instances, you need to carefully manage your plan resources and capacity. Consider plan capacity. Before you add a new application to an existing plan, determine the resource requirements for the new application and identify the remaining capacity of your plan. Important

Overloading an App Service plan can potentially cause downtime for new and existing applications. Consider application isolation. Isolate your application into a new App Service plan when:

The application is resource-intensive. You want to scale the application independently from the other applications in the existing plan. The application needs resource in a different geographical region. Next unit: Determine Azure App Service plan pricing

This allows applications to handle varying loads efficiently by scaling out during peak demand and scaling back during low demand, optimizing resource usage and controlling costs."
"After a while, you decide to add a custom DNS name to your web app, so you scale your plan up to the Shared tier. Next, you discover you need to create an SSL binding, so you scale your plan up to the Basic tier. Later, you determine a need for staging environments, so you scale up to the Standard tier. When you need more cores, memory, or storage, you can scale up to a bigger virtual machine size in the same tier. The same scaling process works in reverse. If you decide you no longer need capabilities or features of a higher tier, scale your plan down to a lower tier and save money. Consider autoscale to support users and reduce costs. Keep serving your users when your application is experiencing high throughput. Implement autoscale to control how many features and support are offered at a given time based on your preference settings and rule conditions. Autoscale helps you save money when the load on your application decreases by automatically reducing your subscribed features. Consider no redeployment. When you change your scale settings, you don't need to change your code or redeploy your applications. Changing your plan scale settings takes only seconds to apply. Your changes affect all applications in your App Service plan. Consider scaling for other Azure services. If your App Service application depends on other Azure services, such as Azure SQL Database or Azure Storage, you can scale these resources separately. These resources aren't managed by your App Service plan. Next unit: Configure Azure App Service autoscale


5- Configure Azure App Service autoscale

The autoscale process allows you to have the right amount of resources running to handle the load on your application. You can add resources to support increases in load and save money by removing idle resources. Things to know about autoscale
Let's take a closer look at how to use autoscale for your Azure App Service plan and applications. To use autoscale, you specify the minimum, and maximum number of instances to run by using a set of rules and conditions. When your application runs under autoscale conditions, the number of virtual machine instances are automatically adjusted based on your rules. When rule conditions are met, one or more autoscale actions are triggered. An autoscale setting is read by the autoscale engine to determine whether to scale out or in. Autoscale settings are grouped into profiles. Autoscale rules include a trigger and a scale action (in or out). The trigger can be metric-based or time-based.",What are the benefits of using autoscale in Azure App Service plans?,"The benefits of using autoscale in Azure App Service plans include the ability to handle varying loads by automatically adjusting resources, saving costs by removing idle resources, and ensuring optimal performance without manual intervention.

Implement autoscale to control how many features and support are offered at a given time based on your preference settings and rule conditions. Autoscale helps you save money when the load on your application decreases by automatically reducing your subscribed features. Consider no redeployment. When you change your scale settings, you don't need to change your code or redeploy your applications. Changing your plan scale settings takes only seconds to apply. Your changes affect all applications in your App Service plan. Consider scaling for other Azure services. If your App Service application depends on other Azure services, such as Azure SQL Database or Azure Storage, you can scale these resources separately. These resources aren't managed by your App Service plan. Next unit: Configure Azure App Service autoscale


5- Configure Azure App Service autoscale

The autoscale process allows you to have the right amount of resources running to handle the load on your application. You can add resources to support increases in load and save money by removing idle resources. Things to know about autoscale
Let's take a closer look at how to use autoscale for your Azure App Service plan and applications. To use autoscale, you specify the minimum, and maximum number of instances to run by using a set of rules and conditions. When your application runs under autoscale conditions, the number of virtual machine instances are automatically adjusted based on your rules. When rule conditions are met, one or more autoscale actions are triggered. An autoscale setting is read by the autoscale engine to determine whether to scale out or in. Autoscale settings are grouped into profiles. Autoscale rules include a trigger and a scale action (in or out). The trigger can be metric-based or time-based.","How does scaling in Azure App Service plans work, and what are the options available?","Scaling in Azure App Service plans involves adjusting the resources allocated to your application. You can scale up to higher tiers to access more features, cores, memory, or storage, and scale down to lower tiers to save money when fewer resources are needed. Additionally, you can implement autoscale to automatically adjust the number of virtual machine instances based on load, without changing your code or redeploying applications."
"After a while, you decide to add a custom DNS name to your web app, so you scale your plan up to the Shared tier. Next, you discover you need to create an SSL binding, so you scale your plan up to the Basic tier. Later, you determine a need for staging environments, so you scale up to the Standard tier. When you need more cores, memory, or storage, you can scale up to a bigger virtual machine size in the same tier. The same scaling process works in reverse. If you decide you no longer need capabilities or features of a higher tier, scale your plan down to a lower tier and save money. Consider autoscale to support users and reduce costs.

Triggers for these rules can be metric-based, such as CPU usage or memory consumption, or time-based, allowing for scheduled scaling actions. These rules are organized into profiles and read by the autoscale engine to determine when to scale in or out."
"Screenshot that shows how to create an autoscale condition in the Azure portal, including settings for the scale mode and instance count. Metric-based rules measure application load and add or remove virtual machines based on the load, such as ""do this action when CPU usage is above 50%."" Example metrics include CPU time, Average response time, and Requests. Time-based rules (or, schedule-based) allow you to scale when you see time patterns in your load and want to scale before a possible load increase or decrease occurs. An example is ""trigger a webhook every 8:00 AM on Saturday in a given time zone."" The autoscale engine uses notification settings. A notification setting defines what notifications should occur when an autoscale event occurs based on satisfying the criteria of an autoscale setting profile. Autoscale can notify one or more email addresses or make calls to one or more webhooks. Things to consider when configuring autoscale
There are several considerations to keep in mind when you configure autoscale for your Azure App Service plan and applications. Minimum instance count. Set a minimum instance count to make sure your application is always running even when there's no load. Maximum instance count. Set a maximum instance count to limit your total possible hourly cost. Adequate scale margin. Make sure your maximum and minimum instance count values are different, and set an adequate margin between the two values. You can automatically scale between the minimum and maximum by using rules you create. Scale rule combinations. Always use a scale-out and scale-in rule combination that performs an increase and decrease. If you don't set a scale-out rule, your application might fail, or performance might degrade under increased loads. If you don't set a scale-in rule, you can experience unnecessary and extensive costs when the load decreases. Metric statistics. Carefully choose the appropriate statistic for your diagnostic metrics, including Average, Minimum, Maximum, and Total. Default instance count. Always select a safe default instance count. The default instance count is important because autoscale scales your service to the count you specify when metrics aren't available. Notifications. Always configure autoscale notifications. It's important to maintain awareness of how your application is performing as the load changes. 6- Knowledge check

You're developing a strategy to implement Azure App Service plans to enable scaling requirements for the hotel website. Various teams in your organization have submitted requests and questions for your consideration. The Admin team has requested information about scaling options for their virtual machines. They prefer an option that can increase CPU and disk space rather than having to add more virtual machines.","What are the two types of autoscale rules available in Azure for managing application load, and how do they function?","The two types of autoscale rules available in Azure are metric-based rules and time-based (or schedule-based) rules. Metric-based rules measure application load by monitoring metrics like CPU time, average response time, and requests, and they add or remove virtual machines based on the load, such as triggering actions when CPU usage exceeds a specified threshold. Time-based rules allow scaling based on time patterns in the load, such as triggering actions at specific times when load increases or decreases are anticipated."

Things to know about configuration settings
Let's examine some of the basic configuration settings you need to create an app with App Service. Name: The name for your app must be unique. The name identifies and locates your app in Azure. An example name is webappces1.azurewebsites.net. You can map a custom domain name, if you prefer to use that option instead. Publish: App Service hosts (publishes) your app as code or as a Docker Container. Runtime stack: App Service uses a software stack to run your app, including the language and SDK versions. For Linux apps and custom container apps, you can set an optional start-up command or file. Your choices for the stack include .NET Core, .NET Framework, Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby. Various versions of each product are available for Linux and Windows. Operating system: The operating system for your app runtime stack can be Linux or Windows. Region: The region location that you choose for your app affects the App Service plans that are available. App Service plan: Your app needs to be associated with an Azure App Service plan to establish available resources, features, and capacity. You can choose from pricing tiers that are available for the region location you selected. Post-creation settings
After your app is created, other configuration settings become available in the Azure portal, including app deployment options and path mapping. Screenshot that shows other configuration options for an app with the App Service in the Azure portal. Some of the extra configuration settings can be included in the developer's code, while others can be configured in your app. Here are a few of the extra application settings. Always On: You can keep your app loaded even when there's no traffic. This setting is required for continuous WebJobs or for WebJobs that are triggered by using a CRON expression. ARR affinity: In a multi-instance deployment, you can ensure your app client is routed to the same instance for the life of the session. Connection strings: Connection strings for your app are encrypted at rest and transmitted over an encrypted channel.",What are the key configuration settings needed to create an app with Azure App Service?,"The key configuration settings include the app's unique name, publishing method (code or Docker Container), runtime stack (such as .NET Core, Node.js, etc.), operating system (Linux or Windows), region location, and the associated App Service plan which determines resources, features, and capacity."

4- Explore continuous integration and deployment

The Azure portal provides out-of-the-box continuous integration and deployment with Azure DevOps, GitHub, Bitbucket, FTP, or a local Git repository on your development machine. You can connect your web app with any of the above sources and App Service handles the rest for you. App Service auto-synchronizes your code and any future changes to the code into your web app. With Azure DevOps, you can also define your own build and release process. Compile your source code, run tests, and build and deploy the release into your web app every time you commit the code. All of the operations happen implicitly without any need for human administration. Illustration that shows two developers sharing a single GitHub source to produce a website built with Azure App Service. Things to know about continuous deployment
When you create your web app with App Service, you can choose automated or manual deployment. As you review these options, consider which deployment method to implement for your App Service apps. Automated deployment (continuous integration) is a process used to push out new features and bug fixes in a fast and repetitive pattern with minimal impact on end users. Azure supports automated deployment directly from several sources:

Azure DevOps: Push your code to Azure DevOps (previously known as Visual Studio Team Services), build your code in the cloud, run the tests, generate a release from the code, and finally, push your code to an Azure web app. GitHub: Azure supports automated deployment directly from GitHub. When you connect your GitHub repository to Azure for automated deployment, any changes you push to your production branch on GitHub are automatically deployed for you. Bitbucket: With its similarities to GitHub, you can configure an automated deployment with Bitbucket. Manual deployment enables you to manually push your code to Azure. There are several options for manually pushing your code:

Git: The App Service Web Apps feature offers a Git URL that you can add as a remote repository. Pushing to the remote repository deploys your app. CLI: The webapp up command is a feature of the command-line interface that packages your app and deploys it. Deployment can include creating a new App Service web app. Visual Studio: Visual Studio features an App Service deployment wizard that can walk you through the deployment process. FTP/S: FTP or FTPS is a traditional way of pushing your code to many hosting environments, including App Service.",What is the role of Azure App Service in continuous integration and deployment?,"Azure App Service plays a central role in continuous integration and deployment by automatically synchronizing your code and any future changes into your web app. It allows you to connect your web app with various sources like Azure DevOps, GitHub, Bitbucket, FTP, or a local Git repository, and handles the deployment process, including code compilation, running tests, and building and deploying releases, without the need for manual intervention."

5- Create deployment slots

When you deploy your web app, web app on Linux, mobile backend, or API app to Azure App Service, you can use a separate deployment slot instead of the default production slot. Things to know about deployment slots
Let's take a closer look at the characteristics of deployment slots. Deployment slots are live apps that have their own hostnames. Deployment slots are available in the Standard, Premium, and Isolated App Service pricing tiers. Your app needs to be running in one of these tiers to use deployment slots. The Standard, Premium, and Isolated tiers offer different numbers of deployment slots. App content and configuration elements can be swapped between two deployment slots, including the production slot. Screenshot that shows how to work with deployment slots in the Azure portal. Things to consider when using deployment slots
There are several advantages to using deployment slots with your App Service app. Review the following benefits and think about how they can support your App Service implementation. Consider validation. You can validate changes to your app in a staging deployment slot before swapping the app changes with the content in the production slot. Consider reductions in downtime. Deploying an app to a slot first and swapping it into production ensures that all instances of the slot are warmed up before being swapped into production. This option eliminates downtime when you deploy your app. The traffic redirection is seamless, and no requests are dropped because of swap operations. The entire workflow can be automated by configuring Auto swap when pre-swap validation isn't needed. Consider restoring to last known good site. After a swap, the slot with the previously staged app now has the previous production app. If the changes swapped into the production slot aren't as you expected, you can perform the same swap immediately to return to your ""last known good site."" Consider Auto swap. Auto swap streamlines Azure DevOps scenarios where you want to deploy your app continuously with zero cold starts and zero downtime for app customers. When Auto swap is enabled from a slot into production, every time you push your code changes to that slot, App Service automatically swaps the app into production after it's warmed up in the source slot. Auto swap isn't currently supported for Web Apps on Linux. Next unit: Add deployment slots

Things to consider when using App Service for app security
You configure authentication and authorization security in App Service by selecting features In the Azure portal. Review the following options and think about what security can benefit your App Service apps implementation. Allow Anonymous requests (no action). Defer authorization of unauthenticated traffic to your application code. For authenticated requests, App Service also passes along authentication information in the HTTP headers. This feature provides more flexibility for handling anonymous requests. With this feature, you can present multiple sign-in providers to your users. Allow only authenticated requests.

To map a custom DNS name to your app, you need a paid tier of an App Service plan for your app. Reserve your domain name. The easiest way to set up a custom domain is to buy one directly in the Azure portal. (This name isn't the Azure assigned name of \*.azurewebsites.net.) The registration process enables you to manage your web app's domain name directly in the Azure portal instead of going to a third-party site. Configuring the domain name in your web app is also a simple process in the Azure portal. Create DNS records to map the domain to your Azure web app. The Domain Name System (DNS) uses data records to map domain names to IP addresses. There are several types of DNS records. For web apps, you create either an A (Address) record or a CNAME (Canonical Name) record. An A record maps a domain name to an IP address. A CNAME record maps a domain name to another domain name. DNS uses the second name to look up the address. Users still see the first domain name in their browser. As an example, you could map contoso.com to your webapp.azurewebsites.net URL. If the IP address changes, a CNAME entry is still valid, whereas an A record must be updated. Some domain registrars don't allow CNAME records for the root domain or for wildcard domains. In such cases, you must use an A record. Enable the custom domain. After you have your domain and create your DNS record, use the Azure portal to validate your custom domain and add it to your web app. Be sure to test your domain before publishing.

The top-level resource in Azure Container Instances is the container group. A container group is a collection of containers that get scheduled on the same host machine. The containers in a container group share a lifecycle, resources, local network, and storage volumes. Things to know about container groups
Let's review some of details about container groups for Azure Container Instances. A container group is similar to a pod in Kubernetes. A pod typically has a 1:1 mapping with a container, but a pod can contain multiple containers. The containers in a multi-container pod can share related resources. Azure Container Instances allocates resources to a multi-container group by adding together the resource requests of all containers in the group. Resources can include items such as CPUs, memory, and GPUs. Consider a container group that has two containers that each require CPU resources. Each container requests one CPU. Azure Container Instances allocates two CPUs for the container group. There are two common ways to deploy a multi-container group: Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates and YAML files. ARM template.

The top-level resource in Azure Container Instances is the container group. A container group is a collection of containers that get scheduled on the same host machine. The containers in a container group share a lifecycle, resources, local network, and storage volumes. Things to know about container groups
Let's review some of details about container groups for Azure Container Instances. A container group is similar to a pod in Kubernetes. A pod typically has a 1:1 mapping with a container, but a pod can contain multiple containers. The containers in a multi-container pod can share related resources. Azure Container Instances allocates resources to a multi-container group by adding together the resource requests of all containers in the group. Resources can include items such as CPUs, memory, and GPUs. Consider a container group that has two containers that each require CPU resources. Each container requests one CPU. Azure Container Instances allocates two CPUs for the container group. There are two common ways to deploy a multi-container group: Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates and YAML files. ARM template. An ARM template is recommended for deploying other Azure service resources when you deploy your container instances, such as an Azure Files file share.",What are the two common methods for deploying a multi-container group in Azure Container Instances?,The two common methods for deploying a multi-container group in Azure Container Instances are using Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates and YAML files. ARM templates are recommended for deploying other Azure service resources alongside container instances.
"YAML file. Due to the concise nature of the YAML format, a YAML file is recommended when your deployment includes only container instances. Container groups can share an external-facing IP address, one or more ports on the IP address, and a DNS label with an FQDN. External client access. You must expose the port on the IP address and from the container to enable external clients to reach a container in your group. Port mapping. Port mapping isn't supported because containers in a group share a port namespace. Deleted groups. When a container group is deleted, its IP address and FQDN are released. Configuration example
Consider the following example of a multi-container group with two containers. Diagram that depicts an Azure Container Instances multi-container group that has two containers. The multi-container group has the following characteristics and configuration:

The container group is scheduled on a single host machine, and is assigned a DNS name label. The container group exposes a single public IP address with one exposed port. One container in the group listens on port 80. The other container listens on port 1433. The group includes two Azure Files file shares as volume mounts. Each container in the group mounts one of the file shares locally. Things to consider when using container groups
Multi-container groups are useful when you want to divide a single functional task into a few container images. Different teams can deliver the images, and the images can have separate resource requirements. Consider the following scenarios for working with multi-container groups. Think about what options can support your internal apps for the online retailer. Consider web app updates. Support updates to your web apps by implementing a multi-container group. One container in the group serves the web app and another container pulls the latest content from source control. Consider log data collection. Use a multi-container group to capture logging and metrics data about your app. Your application container outputs logs and metrics. A logging container collects the output data and writes the data to long-term storage. Consider app monitoring. Enable monitoring for your app with a multi-container group. A monitoring container periodically makes a request to your application container to ensure your app is running and responding correctly. The monitoring container raises an alert if it identifies possible issues with your app. Consider front-end and back-end support. Create a multi-container group to hold your front-end container and back-end container. The front-end container can serve a web app. The back-end container can run a service to retrieve data.",What are the advantages of using a multi-container group in Azure Container Instances?,"Multi-container groups are advantageous because they allow you to divide a single functional task into a few container images, enabling different teams to deliver images with separate resource requirements. They also support internal app development, allow for web app updates, facilitate log data collection, and enable application monitoring by organizing containers by their specific roles."

"Point 6: Manage virtual machines with the Azure CLI

Learn how to use the cross-platform Azure CLI to create, start, stop, and perform other management tasks related to virtual machines in Azure. Learning objectives
In this module, you will:

Create a virtual machine with the Azure CLI. Resize virtual machines with the Azure CLI. Perform basic management tasks using the Azure CLI. Connect to a running VM with SSH and the Azure CLI. 1- What is the Azure CLI? It's quite common for IT departments to manage a large set of Azure resources, ranging from Azure Virtual Machines to managed websites. While the Azure portal is easy to use for one-off tasks, navigating through the various panes adds time when you have to create, change, or delete multiple things. This is where the command line shines; you can issue commands quickly and efficiently, or even use scripts to run repetitive tasks. With Azure, you have two different command-line tools you can work with: Azure PowerShell and the Azure CLI. With either of these tools, you can write scripts to check the cloud-server status, deploy new configurations, open ports in the firewall, or connect to a virtual machine to change a setting. Windows admins tend to prefer Azure PowerShell, while developers and Linux admins often use the Azure CLI. This module focuses on using the Azure CLI to create and manage virtual machines hosted in Azure. If you'd like to get an overview of the Azure CLI, how to install it, and how to work with your Azure subscriptions, make sure to check out the Control Azure services with the CLI training module. What is the Azure CLI? The Azure CLI is Microsoft's cross-platform command-line tool for managing Azure resources. It's available for macOS, Linux, and Windows, or in the browser using Azure Cloud Shell. The Azure CLI can help you manage Azure resources such as virtual machines and disks from the command line or in scripts. Let's get started and see what it can do with Azure Virtual Machines.

Create a virtual machine with the Azure CLI. Resize virtual machines with the Azure CLI. Perform basic management tasks using the Azure CLI. Connect to a running VM with SSH and the Azure CLI. 1- What is the Azure CLI? It's quite common for IT departments to manage a large set of Azure resources, ranging from Azure Virtual Machines to managed websites. While the Azure portal is easy to use for one-off tasks, navigating through the various panes adds time when you have to create, change, or delete multiple things. This is where the command line shines; you can issue commands quickly and efficiently, or even use scripts to run repetitive tasks. With Azure, you have two different command-line tools you can work with: Azure PowerShell and the Azure CLI. With either of these tools, you can write scripts to check the cloud-server status, deploy new configurations, open ports in the firewall, or connect to a virtual machine to change a setting. Windows admins tend to prefer Azure PowerShell, while developers and Linux admins often use the Azure CLI. This module focuses on using the Azure CLI to create and manage virtual machines hosted in Azure.

"Logins, subscriptions, and resource groups
You'll be working in the Azure Cloud Shell on the right. Once you activate the sandbox, you'll be logged into Azure with a free subscription that Microsoft Learn manages. You don't have to log in to Azure on your own or select a subscription; this is done for you. You'd also normally create a resource group to hold new resources. In this module, the Azure sandbox creates a resource group for you, which you'll use to execute all the commands. Create a Linux VM with the Azure CLI
The Azure CLI includes the vm command to work with virtual machines in Azure. We can supply several subcommands to do specific tasks. The most common include:

Sub-command	Description
create	Create a new virtual machine
deallocate	Deallocate a virtual machine
delete	Delete a virtual machine
list	List the created virtual machines in your subscription
open-port	Open a specific network port for inbound traffic
restart	Restart a virtual machine
show	Get the details for a virtual machine
start	Start a stopped virtual machine
stop	Stop a running virtual machine
update	Update a property of a virtual machine
 Note

For a complete list of commands, you can check the Azure CLI reference documentation. Let's start with the first one: az vm create.

4- Exercise - Explore other VM images

We used UbuntuLTS for the image to create the virtual machine. Azure has several standard VM images you can use to create a virtual machine. Listing images
You can get a list of the available VM images using the following command:

Azure CLI

Copy
az vm image list --output table
 Note

If you get the error az: command not found, type exit into the shell and try again.",How can you list the available VM images in Azure according to the text?,"You can list the available VM images in Azure by using the Azure CLI command: az vm image list --output table. This command will provide a table of the available images that can be used to create a virtual machine in Azure. If the command is not found, you may need to exit the shell and try again."
"This outputs the most popular images that are part of an offline list built into the Azure CLI. However, there are hundreds of image options available in the Azure Marketplace. Getting all images
You can get a full list by adding the --all flag to the command. Because the list of images in the Marketplace is very large, it's helpful to filter the list with the --publisher, --sku or –-offer options. For example, try the following command to see all Wordpress images available:

Azure CLI

Copy
az vm image list --sku Wordpress --output table --all
Or this command to see all images provided by Microsoft:

Azure CLI

Copy
az vm image list --publisher Microsoft --output table --all
These commands can take a few moments to complete. Location-specific images
Some images are only available in certain locations. Try adding the --location [location] flag to the command to scope the results to ones available in the region where you want to create the virtual machine. For example, type the following into Azure Cloud Shell to get a list of images available in the eastus region. Azure CLI

Copy
az vm image list --location eastus --output table
Try checking some of the images in the other Azure sandbox available locations:

westus2
southcentralus
centralus
eastus
westeurope
southeastasia
japaneast
brazilsouth
australiasoutheast
centralindia
 Tip

These are the standard images that are provided by Azure. Keep in mind that you can also create and upload your own custom images to create VMs based on unique configurations or less common versions or distributions of an operating system. Your command window is probably full now. If you like, you can type clear to clear the screen. Next unit: Exercise - Sizing VMs properly


5- Exercise - Sizing VMs properly

Virtual machines must be sized appropriately for the expected work. A VM without the correct amount of memory or CPU will fail under load or run too slowly to be effective. Predefined VM sizes
When you create a virtual machine, you can supply a VM size value that determines the amount of compute resources devoted to the VM, including CPU, GPU, and memory made available to the virtual machine from Azure. Azure defines a set of predefined VM sizes for Linux and Windows from which to choose based on the expected usage.",How can you list all available Wordpress images in the Azure Marketplace using the Azure CLI?,You can list all available Wordpress images in the Azure Marketplace by using the command `az vm image list --sku Wordpress --output table --all` in the Azure CLI.

Now that we've created a virtual machine, we can get information about it through other commands. Let's start by running vm list. Azure CLI

Copy
az vm list
This command will return all virtual machines defined in this subscription. You can filter the output to a specific resource group through the --resource-group parameter. Output types
Notice that the default response type for all the commands we've done so far is JSON. This is great for scripting, but most people find it harder to read. You can change the output style for any response through the --output flag. For example, run the following command in Azure Cloud Shell to see the different output style. Azure CLI

Copy
az vm list --output table
Along with table, you can specify json (the default), jsonc (colorized JSON), or tsv (Tab-Separated Values). Try a few variations with the preceding command to see the difference. Get the IP address
Another useful command is vm list-ip-addresses, which lists the public and private IP addresses for a VM. If they change, or you didn't capture them during creation, you can retrieve them at any time. Azure CLI

Copy
az vm list-ip-addresses -n SampleVM -o table

"Azure CLI

Copy
az vm show --resource-group ""[sandbox resource group name]"" --name SampleVM

Again, we could change to a table format, but that omits almost all of the interesting data. Instead, we can turn to a built-in query language for JSON called JMESPath. Add filters to queries with JMESPath
JMESPath is an industry-standard query language built around JSON objects. The simplest query is to specify an identifier that selects a key in the JSON object. For example, given the object:

JSON

Copy
{
  ""people"": [
    {
      ""name"": ""Fred"",
      ""age"": 28
    },
    {
      ""name"": ""Barney"",
      ""age"": 25
    },
    {
      ""name"": ""Wilma"",
      ""age"": 27
    }
  ]
}
We can use the query people to return the array of values for the people array. If we just want one of the people, we can use an indexer. For example, people[1] would return:

JSON

Copy
{
    ""name"": ""Barney"",
    ""age"": 25
}
We can also add specific qualifiers that would return a subset of the objects based on some criteria. For example, adding the qualifier people[?age > '25'] would return:

JSON

Copy
[
  {
    ""name"": ""Fred"",
    ""age"": 28
  },
  {
    ""name"": ""Wilma"",
    ""age"": 27
  }
]
Finally, we can constrain the results by adding a select: people[?age > '25']. [name] that returns just the names:

JSON

Copy
[
  [
    ""Fred""
  ],
  [
    ""Wilma""
  ]
]

With a basic understanding of JMES queries, we can add filters to the data returned by queries like the vm show command.",How can you retrieve only the names of people older than 25 using JMESPath?,"To retrieve only the names of people older than 25 using JMESPath, you can use a query with a qualifier and a select operation: `people[?age > '25']. [name]`. This query filters out people with an age greater than 25 and then selects only the 'name' attribute from those objects, returning the names in a list format."
"For example, we can retrieve the admin username:

Azure CLI

Copy
az vm show \
    --resource-group ""[sandbox resource group name]"" \
    --name SampleVM \
    --query ""osProfile.adminUsername""
We can get the size assigned to our VM:

Azure CLI

Copy
az vm show \
    --resource-group ""[sandbox resource group name]"" \
    --name SampleVM \
    --query hardwareProfile.vmSize
Or, to retrieve all the IDs for your network interfaces, we can run the query:

Azure CLI

Copy
az vm show \
    --resource-group ""[sandbox resource group name]"" \
    --name SampleVM \
    --query ""networkProfile.networkInterfaces[].id""
This query technique works with any Azure CLI command, and you can use it to pull specific bits of data out on the command line. It's useful for scripting, as well. For example, you can pull a value out of your Azure account and store it in an environment or script variable. If you decide to use it this way, it's useful to add the --output tsv parameter (which you can shorten to -o tsv). This will return results that only include the actual data values with tab separators. For example:

Azure CLI

Copy
az vm show \
    --resource-group ""[sandbox resource group name]"" \
    --name SampleVM \
    --query ""networkProfile.networkInterfaces[].id"" -o tsv
returns the text: /subscriptions/20f4b944-fc7a-4d38-b02c-900c8223c3a0/resourceGroups/2568d0d0-efe3-4d04-a08f-df7f009f822a/providers/Microsoft.Network/networkInterfaces/SampleVMVMNic

7- Exercise - Start and stop your VM with the Azure CLI

One of the main tasks you'll want to do while running virtual machines is to start and stop them. Stop a VM
We can stop a running VM with the vm stop command. You must pass the name and resource group, or the unique ID for the VM:

Azure CLI

Copy

Imagine that you work for a company that does video-data processing and pattern analysis. You're building a new prototype platform to process the video from traffic cameras, analyze trends, and provide actionable data for traffic and road improvements. To improve your algorithms, you've made arrangements with several new cities to collect their traffic-camera data. However, not all of the video data is in the same format, and many of the formats only have Windows codecs to decode the data. Therefore, you've decided to use Virtual Machines (VMs) to do the initial processing and then push the data onto Azure Functions, which will process a standard format. This approach allows you to bring on new data formats dynamically without stopping the entire system. Azure provides a robust virtual machine hosting solution that can meet your needs.

Your company has decided to manage the video data from their traffic cameras in Azure using VMs. In order to run the multiple codecs, we first need to create the VMs. We also need to connect and interact with the VMs. In this unit, you'll learn how to create a VM using the Azure portal. You'll configure the VM for remote access, select a VM image, and choose the proper storage option. Introduction to Windows virtual machines in Azure
Azure VMs are an on-demand, scalable cloud-computing resource. They're similar to virtual machines that are hosted in Windows Hyper-V. They include processor, memory, storage, and networking resources. You can start and stop virtual machines at will, just like with Hyper-V, and manage them from the Azure portal or with the Azure CLI. You can also use a Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) client to connect directly to the Windows desktop user interface (UI) and use the VM as if you were signed in to a local Windows computer. Create an Azure VM
You can define and deploy VMs on Azure in several ways: the Azure portal, a script (using the Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell), or through an Azure Resource Manager template. In all cases, you'll need to supply several pieces of information, which we'll cover shortly. The Azure Marketplace also provides preconfigured images that include both an OS and popular software tools installed for specific scenarios.

When creating a Windows VM in Azure, you also create resources to host the VM. These resources work together to virtualize a computer and run the Windows operating system. These must either exist (and be selected during VM creation), or they'll be created with the VM.","What are some of the resources created alongside a Windows VM in Azure, and how are they used?","When creating a Windows VM in Azure, resources such as processor, memory, storage, and networking components are created to host the VM. These resources work together to virtualize a computer and run the Windows operating system, either by selecting existing resources or creating new ones during the VM creation process."
"A virtual machine that provides CPU and memory resources
An Azure Storage account to hold the virtual hard disks
Virtual disks to hold the OS, applications, and data
A virtual network (VNet) to connect the VM to other Azure services or your own on-premises hardware
A network interface to communicate with the VNet
A public IP address so you can access the VM (this is optional)
Like other Azure services, you'll need a resource group to contain the VM (and optionally group these resources together for administration). When you create a new VM, you can either use an existing resource group or create a new one. Choose the VM image
Selecting an image is one of the first and most important decisions you'll make when creating a VM. An image is a template that's used to create a VM. These templates include an OS and often other software, such as development tools or web-hosting environments. You can include any application that the computer can support in the VM image. You can create a VM from an image that's preconfigured to exactly match your requirements, such as hosting an ASP.NET Core app. Tip

You can also create and upload your own images. Check the documentation for more information. Size your VM
Just as a physical machine has a certain amount of memory and CPU power, so does a virtual machine. Azure offers a range of VMs of differing sizes at different price points. The size that you choose will determine the VM's processing power, memory, and max storage capacity. Warning

There are quota limits on each subscription that can impact VM creation. In the classic deployment model, you can't have more than 20 virtual cores across all VMs within a region. You can either split up VMs across regions or file an online request to increase your limits. VM sizes are grouped into categories, starting with the B-series for basic testing, and running up to the H-series for massive computing tasks. You should select the VM's size based on the workload you want to perform. It's possible to change a VM's size after it's been created, but the VM must be stopped first, so it's best to size it appropriately from the start if possible. Here are some guidelines based on the scenario you're targeting:
What are you doing?",What are the key components required to set up a virtual machine in Azure?,"To set up a virtual machine in Azure, you need CPU and memory resources, an Azure Storage account for virtual hard disks, virtual disks for the OS, applications, and data, a virtual network (VNet) for connectivity, a network interface for communication with the VNet, and optionally a public IP address for access. Additionally, a resource group is needed to contain the VM and related resources."

The next set of decisions revolves around storage. First, you can choose the disk technology. Options include a traditional platter-based hard disk drive (HDD) or a more modern solid-state drive (SSD). Just like the hardware you purchase, SSD storage costs more, but provides better performance. Tip

There are two levels of SSD storage available: Standard and Premium. Choose Standard SSD disks if you have normal workloads but want better performance. Choose Premium SSD disks if you have I/O intensive workloads or mission-critical systems that need to process data very quickly. Map storage to disks
Azure uses virtual hard disks (VHDs) to represent physical disks for the VM. VHDs replicate the logical format and data of a disk drive, but are stored as page blobs in an Azure Storage account. You can choose on a per-disk basis what type of storage it should use (SSD or HDD). This allows you to control each disk's performance, likely based on the I/O you plan to perform on it. By default, two virtual hard disks (VHDs) will be created for your Windows VM:

The Operating System disk: This is your primary or C: drive and has a maximum capacity of 2048 GB. A Temporary disk: This provides temporary storage for the OS or any apps. It's configured as the D: drive by default and is sized based on the VM size, making it an ideal location for the Windows paging file. Warning

"You should only write data to this disk that you're willing to lose at any time. What about data? You can store data on the C: drive along with the OS, but a better approach is to create dedicated data disks. You can create and attach additional disks to the VM. Each data disk can hold up to 32,767 gibibytes (GiB) of data, with the maximum amount of storage determined by the VM size you select. Note

An interesting capability is to create a VHD image from a real disk. This allows you to easily migrate existing information from an on-premises computer to the cloud. Unmanaged vs. Managed disks
The final storage choice you'll make is whether to use unmanaged or managed disks. With unmanaged disks, you're responsible for the storage accounts that are used to hold the VHDs corresponding to your VM disks. You pay the storage account rates for the amount of space you use. A single storage account has a fixed rate limit of 20,000 I/O operations/sec. This means that a single storage account is capable of supporting 40 standard virtual hard disks at full throttle. If you need to scale out, then you need more than one storage account, which can get complicated. Managed disks are the newer (and recommended) disk-storage model. They elegantly solve the complexity of unmanaged disks by putting the burden of managing the storage accounts onto Azure. You specify the disk type (Premium or Standard) and the disk size, and Azure creates and manages both the disk and the storage it uses. You don't have to worry about storage account limits, which makes them easier to scale out. They also offer several other benefits:

Increased reliability: Azure ensures that VHDs associated with high-reliability VMs will be placed in different parts of Azure storage to provide similar levels of resilience. Better security: Managed disks are truly managed resources in the resource group. This means they can use role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict who can work with the VHD data. Snapshot support: You can use snapshots to create a read-only copy of a VHD. You have to shut down the owning VM, but creating the snapshot only takes a few seconds. Once it's done, you can power on the VM and use the snapshot to create a duplicate VM to troubleshoot a production issue or roll back the VM to the point in time that the snapshot was taken.",What are the benefits of using managed disks over unmanaged disks in Azure?,"Managed disks in Azure offer several benefits over unmanaged disks, including increased reliability, better security, and easier scalability.

"Backup support: You can automatically back up managed disks to different regions for disaster recovery with Azure Backup, all without affecting the service of the VM. Network communication
Virtual machines communicate with external resources using a virtual network (VNet). The VNet represents a private network in a single region on which your resources communicate. A virtual network is just like the networks you manage on-premises. You can divide them up with subnets to isolate resources, connect them to other networks (including your on-premises networks), and apply traffic rules to govern inbound and outbound connections. Plan your network
When you create a new VM, you'll have the option of creating a new virtual network or using an existing VNet in your region. Having Azure create the network together with the VM is simple, but it's likely not ideal for most scenarios. It's better to plan your network requirements up front for all the components in your architecture and create the VNet structure you'll need separately and then create the VMs and place them into the already-created VNets.

There are several Windows Server options to choose from to create your VM. In the Plan dropdown list, scroll down, and select [smalldisk] Windows Server 2019 Datacenter. Select Create. The Create a virtual machine pane appears. Configure the VM settings
Azure presents a wizard as a series of tabs to walk you through all the configuration details for creating the VM.","What is the role of a virtual network (VNet) in Azure, and how does it compare to on-premises networks?","A virtual network (VNet) in Azure represents a private network within a single region where resources communicate, similar to on-premises networks. You can divide VNets into subnets to isolate resources, connect them to other networks, and apply traffic rules for inbound and outbound connections."
"Backup support: You can automatically back up managed disks to different regions for disaster recovery with Azure Backup, all without affecting the service of the VM. Network communication
Virtual machines communicate with external resources using a virtual network (VNet). The VNet represents a private network in a single region on which your resources communicate. A virtual network is just like the networks you manage on-premises. You can divide them up with subnets to isolate resources, connect them to other networks (including your on-premises networks), and apply traffic rules to govern inbound and outbound connections. Plan your network
When you create a new VM, you'll have the option of creating a new virtual network or using an existing VNet in your region. Having Azure create the network together with the VM is simple, but it's likely not ideal for most scenarios. It's better to plan your network requirements up front for all the components in your architecture and create the VNet structure you'll need separately and then create the VMs and place them into the already-created VNets. We'll look more at virtual networks a bit later in this module. Let's apply some of this knowledge and create a VM in Azure. Next unit: Exercise - Create a Windows virtual machine


3- Exercise - Create a Windows virtual machine

Your company processes video content on Windows VMs. A new city has contracted with your company to process their traffic cameras, but it's a model with which you haven't worked before. You need to create a new Windows VM and install some proprietary codecs in order to process and analyze the new video content. Create a new Windows virtual machine
You can create Windows VMs with the Azure portal, Azure CLI, or Azure PowerShell. The best approach is to use the portal, because the Create a virtual machine wizard collects all the required information and provides hints and validation messages throughout the process. Sign in to the Azure portal using the same account you used to activate the sandbox. On the Azure portal, under Azure services, select Create a resource. The Create a resource pane appears. In Search services and marketplace search box, search for Windows Server and press Enter. Select Windows Server by Microsoft. The Windows Server pane appears. There are several Windows Server options to choose from to create your VM. In the Plan dropdown list, scroll down, and select [smalldisk] Windows Server 2019 Datacenter. Select Create. The Create a virtual machine pane appears. Configure the VM settings
Azure presents a wizard as a series of tabs to walk you through all the configuration details for creating the VM.",What are the recommended steps for creating a new Windows virtual machine using the Azure portal?,"To create a new Windows virtual machine using the Azure portal, sign in to the portal, select 'Create a resource', search for 'Windows Server', choose the preferred Windows Server option, and use the wizard to configure the VM settings, following the guidance and validation provided."
"The first tab is Basics. You can select Next or Previous to move from one tab to another, or you can select any tab in the horizontal menu to move to a customizable configuration section. Screenshot showing **Basics** tab of the **Create a virtual machine** pane. Configure basic VM settings
 Note

As you add or change settings in the wizard, Azure validates each value and places a green check mark next to a validated field, or red error indicator below the field. You can hover over an error indicator to get more information about a validation issue. Note

It's a best practice to use a standard naming convention for resource names so you can easily identify their purpose. Windows VM names are a bit limited; they must be between 1 and 15 characters, cannot contain non-ASCII or special characters, and must be unique in the current resource group. On the Basics tab, enter the following values for each setting. Setting	Value

4- Use RDP to connect to Windows Azure virtual machines

Now that you have a Windows VM in Azure, the next thing you’ll do is put your applications and data on those VMs to process our traffic videos. However, unless you’ve set up a site-to-site VPN to Azure, your Azure VMs won’t be accessible from your local network. If you’re just getting started with Azure, it’s unlikely that you have a working site-to-site VPN, so how can you transfer files to Azure VMs? One easy way is to use Azure’s Remote Desktop Connections feature to share your local drives with your new Azure VMs. Now that we have a new Windows virtual machine, we need to install our custom software onto it. There are several options to choose from:

Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
Custom scripts
Custom VM images (with the software preinstalled)
Let's look at the simplest approach for Windows VMs: Remote Desktop. What is the Remote Desktop Protocol? Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) provides remote connectivity to the UI of Windows-based computers. RDP lets you sign in to a remote physical or virtual Windows computer and control that computer as if you were seated at the console. An RDP connection allows you to carry out most operations that you can do from a physical computer's console, except for some power and hardware-related functions. An RDP connection requires an RDP client. Microsoft provides RDP clients for the following operating systems:

Windows (built-in)
macOS
iOS
Android
The following screenshot displays the Remote Desktop Protocol client in Windows 10. Screenshot of the user interface of the Remote Desktop Protocol client. There are also open-source Linux clients, such as Remmina, that allow you to connect to a Windows PC from an Ubuntu distribution. Connecting to an Azure VM
As we learned a moment ago, Azure VMs communicate on a virtual network. They can also have an optional public IP address assigned to them. With a public IP, we can communicate with the VM over the Internet. Alternatively, we can set up a virtual private network (VPN) that connects our on-premises network to Azure, letting us securely connect to the VM without exposing a public IP. This approach is covered in another module, and is fully documented if you're interested in exploring that option. One thing to be aware of with public IP addresses in Azure is they're often dynamically allocated.",What is the primary method recommended for transferring files to Azure virtual machines if you do not have a site-to-site VPN set up?,The primary method recommended for transferring files to Azure virtual machines without a site-to-site VPN is using Azure's Remote Desktop Connections feature to share your local drives with the Azure VMs.

One thing to be aware of with public IP addresses in Azure is they're often dynamically allocated.",How can Azure virtual machines be accessed if they do not have a public IP address?,"Azure virtual machines without a public IP address can be accessed by setting up a virtual private network (VPN) that connects your on-premises network to Azure, allowing for secure connections to the VM without exposing a public IP."
"That means the IP address can change over time; for VMs, this happens when the VM is restarted. You can pay more to assign static addresses if you want to connect directly to an IP address instead of a name and need to ensure that the IP address won't change. How do you connect to a VM in Azure using RDP? Connecting to a VM in Azure using RDP is a simple process. In the Azure portal, you'll go to your VM's properties, and at the top, select Connect. This shows you the IP addresses assigned to the VM and give you the option to download a preconfigured.rdp file that Windows then opens in the RDP client. You can choose to connect over the public IP address of the VM in the RDP file. Instead, if you're connecting over VPN or ExpressRoute, you can select the internal IP address. You can also select the port number for the connection. If you're using a static public IP address for the VM, you can save the .rdp file to your desktop. If you're using dynamic IP addressing, the .rdp file only remains valid while the VM is running. If you stop and restart the VM, you must download another .rdp file. Tip

You can also enter the public IP address of the VM into the Windows RDP client and select Connect. When you connect, you'll typically receive two warnings. These are:

Publisher warning: caused by the .rdp file not being publicly signed
Certificate warning: caused by the machine certificate not being trusted
In test environments, you can ignore these warnings. In production environments, the .rdp file can be signed using RDPSIGN.EXE and the machine certificate placed in the client's Trusted Root Certification Authorities store.

5- Exercise - Connect to a Windows virtual machine using RDP

We have our Windows VM deployed and running, but it's not configured to do any work. Recall that our scenario is a video-processing system. Our platform receives files through FTP. The traffic cameras upload video clips to a known URL, which is mapped to a folder on the server. The custom software on each Windows VM runs as a service and watches the folder and processes each uploaded clip. It then passes the normalized video to our algorithms running on other Azure services.","What is the impact of using dynamic IP addresses for virtual machines in Azure, and how can this be managed when connecting via RDP?","Using dynamic IP addresses means the IP address can change when the VM is restarted, which affects the validity of RDP connection files. To manage this, you need to download a new .rdp file each time the VM restarts, or you can opt to pay more for a static IP address to ensure the IP remains constant."

To support FTP, you need to adjust the configuration by opening the necessary ports to allow FTP traffic, which can be done through the Azure portal or command-line tools."
"When you create a new VM, you have an opportunity to open a few common ports (RDP, HTTP, HTTPS, and SSH). However, if you require other changes to the firewall, you will need to make them yourself. The process for this involves two steps:

Create a Network Security Group. Create an inbound rule allowing traffic on port 20 and 21 for active FTP support. What is a Network Security Group? Virtual networks (VNets) are the foundation of the Azure networking model, and provide isolation and protection. Network Security Groups (NSGs) are the main tool you use to enforce and control network traffic rules at the networking level. NSGs are an optional security layer that provides a software firewall by filtering inbound and outbound traffic on the VNet. Security groups can be associated to a network interface (for per-host rules), a subnet in the virtual network (to apply to multiple resources), or both levels. Security group rules
NSGs use rules to allow or deny traffic moving through the network. Each rule identifies the source and destination address (or range), protocol, port (or range), direction (inbound or outbound), a numeric priority, and whether to allow or deny the traffic that matches the rule. The following illustration shows NSG rules applied at the subnet and network-interface levels. Illustration showing the architecture of network security groups in two different subnets. In one subnet, there are two virtual machines, each with their own network interface rules. The subnet itself has a set of rules that applies to both the virtual machines. Each security group has a set of default security rules to apply the default network rules described in the preceding passage. You can't modify these default rules, but you can override them. How Azure uses network rules
For inbound traffic, Azure processes the security group associated to the subnet, then the security group applied to the network interface. Outbound traffic is processed in the opposite order (the network interface first, followed by the subnet). Warning

Keep in mind that security groups are optional at both levels. If no security group is applied, then all traffic is allowed by Azure. If the VM has a public IP, this could be a serious risk, particularly if the OS doesn't provide some sort of firewall. The rules are evaluated in priority order, starting with the lowest priority rule. Deny rules always stop the evaluation. For example, if an outbound request is blocked by a network interface rule, any rules applied to the subnet will not be checked.","What is a Network Security Group (NSG) in Azure, and what is its primary function?",A Network Security Group (NSG) in Azure is a main tool used to enforce and control network traffic rules at the networking level. Its primary function is to provide a software firewall that filters inbound and outbound traffic on a virtual network (VNet) to enhance security through isolation and protection.
"When you create a new VM, you have an opportunity to open a few common ports (RDP, HTTP, HTTPS, and SSH). However, if you require other changes to the firewall, you will need to make them yourself. The process for this involves two steps:

Create a Network Security Group. Create an inbound rule allowing traffic on port 20 and 21 for active FTP support. What is a Network Security Group? Virtual networks (VNets) are the foundation of the Azure networking model, and provide isolation and protection. Network Security Groups (NSGs) are the main tool you use to enforce and control network traffic rules at the networking level. NSGs are an optional security layer that provides a software firewall by filtering inbound and outbound traffic on the VNet. Security groups can be associated to a network interface (for per-host rules), a subnet in the virtual network (to apply to multiple resources), or both levels. Security group rules
NSGs use rules to allow or deny traffic moving through the network. Each rule identifies the source and destination address (or range), protocol, port (or range), direction (inbound or outbound), a numeric priority, and whether to allow or deny the traffic that matches the rule. The following illustration shows NSG rules applied at the subnet and network-interface levels. Illustration showing the architecture of network security groups in two different subnets. In one subnet, there are two virtual machines, each with their own network interface rules. The subnet itself has a set of rules that applies to both the virtual machines. Each security group has a set of default security rules to apply the default network rules described in the preceding passage. You can't modify these default rules, but you can override them.

This could pose a serious security risk if the virtual machine has a public IP and the operating system does not provide any firewall protection, as it leaves the network vulnerable to unauthorized access."
"In order for traffic to be allowed through the security group, it must pass through all applied groups. The last rule is always a Deny All rule. This is a default rule added to every security group for both inbound and outbound traffic with a priority of 65500. That means to have traffic pass through the security group, you must have an allow rule or the default final rule will block it. Learn more about security rules. Note

SMTP (port 25) is a special case. Depending on your subscription level and when your account was created, outbound SMTP traffic might be blocked. You can make a request to remove this restriction with business justification. Next unit: Summary


Summary

In this module, you learned how to create a Windows VM using the Azure portal. You then connected to the VM's public IP address and managed it over RDP. You discovered how RDP in Azure provides a similar experience to logging on interactively to a physical computer. You learned that while RDP allows us to interact with the operating system and software of the virtual machine, the portal allows us to configure the virtual hardware and connectivity. We also could have used PowerShell or the Azure CLI, if we preferred a command-line or scriptable environment. Clean up
The sandbox automatically cleans up your resources when you're finished with this module. When you're working in your own subscription, it's a good idea at the end of a project to identify whether you still need the resources you created. Resources that you leave running can cost you money. You can delete resources individually or delete the resource group to delete the entire set of resources. Knowledge check

"For instance, you can create a staging deployment slot where you can push your code to test on Azure. Once you're happy with your code, you can easily swap the staging deployment slot with the production slot. You do all this with a few mouse clicks in the Azure portal. Screenshot of the staging deployment slot to test the deployments. Continuous integration/deployment support
The Azure portal provides out-of-the-box continuous integration and deployment with Azure Repos, GitHub, Bitbucket, FTP, or a local Git repository on your development machine. Connect your web app with any of the preceding sources, and App Service will do the rest for you by automatically syncing your code and any future changes on the code into the web app. Furthermore, with Azure Repos, you can define your own build and release process that compiles your source code, runs the tests, builds a release, and finally deploys the release into your web app every time you commit the code. All that happens implicitly, without any need for you to intervene. Screenshot of setting up deployment options and choosing source for the deployment source code. Integrated Visual Studio publishing and FTP publishing
In addition to being able to set up continuous integration/deployment for your web app, you can always benefit from the tight integration with Visual Studio to publish your web app to Azure via Web Deploy technology. App Service also supports FTP-based publishing for more traditional workflows. Built-in autoscale support (automatic scale-out based on real-world load)
Scaling up/down or scaling out is baked into the web app. Depending on the web app's usage, you can scale your app up/down by increasing/decreasing the resources of the underlying machine that's hosting your web app. Resources can be the number of cores or the amount of RAM available. Scaling out, on the other hand, is the ability to increase the number of machine instances that are running your web app. Creating a web app
When you're ready to run a web app on Azure, you can visit the Azure portal and create a Web App resource.

If your target runtime stack is available on both operating systems, select the one that you use to develop and test your application. If your application is packaged as a container, specify the operating system in your container. App Service plans
An App Service plan is a set of virtual server resources that run App Service apps. A plan's size (sometimes referred to as its sku or pricing tier) determines the performance characteristics of the virtual servers that run the apps assigned to the plan, and the App Service features to which those apps have access. Every App Service web app you create must be assigned to a single App Service plan that runs it. A single App Service plan can host multiple App Service web apps. In most cases, the number of apps you can run on a single plan is limited by the apps' performance characteristics and the plan's resource limitations. App Service plans App Service's unit of billing. The size of each App Service plan in your subscription, in addition to the bandwidth resources the apps deployed to those plans use, determines the price you pay. The number of web apps deployed to your App Service plans has no effect on your bill.

The number of web apps deployed to your App Service plans has no effect on your bill. You can use any of the available Azure management tools to create an App Service plan.",How does the choice of runtime stack affect the deployment process in Azure App Service?,"If you deploy your application as code, Azure App Service needs to know the runtime your application uses, such as Node.js, Python, Java, or .NET. This choice can affect the operating system options available. If your application is deployed as a container, you don't need to choose a runtime stack, as it is included in the image."
"This name becomes part of the app's URL, so it must be unique among all Azure App Service web apps. Publish	You can deploy your application to App Service as code or as a ready-to-run Docker Container. Selecting Container will activate the wizard's Container tab, where you'll provide information about the Docker registry from which App Service will retrieve your image. Runtime stack	If you choose to deploy your application as code, App Service needs to know what runtime your application uses (examples include Node.js, Python, Java, and .NET). If you deploy your application as a container, you won't need to choose a runtime stack, because your image includes it. Operating system	App Service can host applications on Windows or Linux servers. For more information, see the Operating systems section in this unit. Region	The Azure region from which your application will be served. Pricing Plans	See the Pricing Plans section in this unit for information about App Service plans. Operating systems
If you're deploying your app as code, many of the available runtime stacks are limited to one operating system or the other. After you choose a runtime stack, the toggle will indicate whether or not you have a choice of operating system. If your target runtime stack is available on both operating systems, select the one that you use to develop and test your application. If your application is packaged as a container, specify the operating system in your container. App Service plans
An App Service plan is a set of virtual server resources that run App Service apps. A plan's size (sometimes referred to as its sku or pricing tier) determines the performance characteristics of the virtual servers that run the apps assigned to the plan, and the App Service features to which those apps have access. Every App Service web app you create must be assigned to a single App Service plan that runs it. A single App Service plan can host multiple App Service web apps. In most cases, the number of apps you can run on a single plan is limited by the apps' performance characteristics and the plan's resource limitations. App Service plans App Service's unit of billing. The size of each App Service plan in your subscription, in addition to the bandwidth resources the apps deployed to those plans use, determines the price you pay. The number of web apps deployed to your App Service plans has no effect on your bill. You can use any of the available Azure management tools to create an App Service plan.",What factors should be considered when choosing an App Service plan for hosting web apps?,"When choosing an App Service plan, consider the plan's size, which determines the performance characteristics and features available to the apps. The number of apps that can be hosted on a single plan is typically limited by the apps' performance needs and the plan's resource constraints. The plan size and bandwidth resources used by the apps determine the cost, but the number of apps does not affect the bill."

Automated deployment, or continuous integration, is a process used to push out new features and bug fixes in a fast and repetitive pattern with minimal impact on end users. Azure supports automated deployment directly from several sources. The following options are available:

Azure Repos: You can push your code to Azure Repos, build your code in the cloud, run the tests, generate a release from the code, and finally push your code to an Azure Web App. GitHub: Azure supports automated deployment directly from GitHub. When you connect your GitHub repository to Azure for automated deployment, any changes you push to your production branch on GitHub will be automatically deployed for you. Bitbucket: Due to its similarities to GitHub, you can configure an automated deployment with Bitbucket. Manual deployment
There are a few options that you can use to manually push your code to Azure:

Git: App Service web apps feature a Git URL that you can add as a remote repository. Pushing to the remote repository will deploy your app. az webapp up: webapp up is a feature of the az command-line interface that packages your app and deploys it.",What are some methods to manually deploy code to Azure App Service?,"To manually deploy code to Azure App Service, you can use a Git URL provided by App Service to push your code as a remote repository. Additionally, you can use the ""az webapp up"" command from the Azure command-line interface to package and deploy your app."
"Unlike other deployment methods, az webapp up can create a new App Service web app for you if you haven't already created one. Deploy application packages: You can use az webapp deploy to deploy a ZIP, WAR, EAR, or JAR to App Service. You can also deploy scripts and static files with the same method. Visual Studio: Visual Studio features an App Service deployment wizard that walks you through the deployment process. FTP/S: FTP or FTPS is a traditional way of pushing your code to many hosting environments, including App Service. Next unit: Exercise - Deploy your code to App Service


7- Exercise - Deploy your code to App Service

In this unit, you deploy your web application to App Service. Deploy with az webapp up
Let's deploy our Python application with az webapp up. This command packages up our application and sends it to our App Service instance, where the app is built and deployed. First, we need to gather some information about our web app resource. Run these commands to set shell variables that contain our app's name, resource group name, plan name, sku, and location. These use different az commands to request the information from Azure; az webapp up needs these values to target our existing web app. Bash

Copy
export APPNAME=$(az webapp list --query [0].name --output tsv)
export APPRG=$(az webapp list --query [0].resourceGroup --output tsv)
export APPPLAN=$(az appservice plan list --query [0].name --output tsv)
export APPSKU=$(az appservice plan list --query [0].sku.name --output tsv)
export APPLOCATION=$(az appservice plan list --query [0].location --output tsv)
Now, run az webapp up with the appropriate values. Make sure you're in the BestBikeApp directory before running this command. Bash

Copy
cd ~/BestBikeApp
az webapp up --name $APPNAME --resource-group $APPRG --plan $APPPLAN --sku $APPSKU --location ""$APPLOCATION""
The deployment takes a few minutes, during which time you get status output. Verify the deployment
Let's browse to your application. In the output, just before the JSON code block, there's a line with a URL. Select that link to open your app in a new browser tab. The page might take a moment to load because the App Service is initializing your app for the first time.",What is one advantage of using the az webapp up command for deploying applications to Azure App Service?,"One advantage of using the az webapp up command is that it can create a new App Service web app for you if you haven't already created one, making it a convenient option for quickly deploying applications."
"Unlike other deployment methods, az webapp up can create a new App Service web app for you if you haven't already created one.

"1- Introduction

Information technology workers understand the importance of data to the organization. The need to protect that data drives decisions around storage, backups, and security. Many companies implement policies that dictate backup specifications for frequency, duration of storage for the backup, and restore policies. For on-premises scenarios, backup solutions might have included local redundant storage solutions or off-site storage. Scenarios using backup to tape drives and storing offsite come with the resulting delay in restoring the data because of the need to transport the tapes back to the server rooms, and from performing the restore operation. It can result in significant downtime. These backup solutions may not always address some of the most important considerations such as security of the backups, the potential for the company to be impacted by a ransomware attack, or human error in the backup and restore operations. An ideal solution would be cost-effective, simple to use, and secure. This is where Azure Backup comes in.

It is also suitable for application admins who need to perform self-service backup and restore to address data corruption or rogue admin scenarios."
"It increases ease of use by automating storage management. At-scale management	Natively manage your entire backup estate from a central console called Backup Center. Use APIs, PowerShell, and Azure CLI to automate Backup policy and security configurations. Backup center simplifies data protection management at-scale by enabling you to discover, govern, monitor, operate, and optimize backup management, all from one unified console, helping you to drive operational efficiency with Azure. Security	Azure Backup provides built-in security to your backup environment, both when your data is in transit and at rest by using capabilities encryption, private endpoints, alerts, and so on. Your backups are automatically secured against ransomware, malicious admins, and accidental deletions. How do Recovery Time Objective and Recovery Point Objective work? Recovery Time Objective (RTO) is the target time within which a business process must be restored after a disaster occurs to avoid unacceptable consequences. For instance, if a critical application goes down due to a server failure and the business can only tolerate a maximum of four hours of downtime, then the RTO is four hours. Recovery Point Objective (RPO) is the maximum amount of data loss, measured in time, that your organization can sustain during an event. The following example scenario describes both the RPO and RTO concepts:

Your organization has an RPO of one hour for your customer database, which means you perform backups every hour. If a data loss incident occurs, you lose not more than one hour of data. When you set RTO to three hours, then if a system failure occurs, you aim to restore access to the database within three hours to minimize the impact on operations.

3- How Azure Backup works

Let's take a look at how Azure Backup works to provide the data protection you need. You'll learn how the different aspects of the backup service make it easy to back up various types of data and how it offers security for your backups as well. We'll discover these aspects of the Azure Backup Service:

Workload integration layer - Backup Extension. Integration with the actual workload (such as Azure VM or Azure Blobs) happens at this layer. Data Plane - Access Tiers. Three access tiers where the backups could be stored:
Snapshot tier
Standard tier
Archive tier
Data Plane - Availability and Security. The backup data is replicated across zones or regions (based on the redundancy specified by the user). Management Plane – Recovery Services vault/Backup vault and Backup center. Vault provides an interface for the user to interact with the backup service.",How does Azure Backup enhance ease of use for managing data protection?,"Azure Backup enhances ease of use by automating storage management through a central console called Backup Center. It allows users to manage their entire backup estate at scale using APIs, PowerShell, and Azure CLI, simplifying data protection management by enabling discovery, governance, monitoring, operation, and optimization from one unified console."
"It increases ease of use by automating storage management. At-scale management	Natively manage your entire backup estate from a central console called Backup Center. Use APIs, PowerShell, and Azure CLI to automate Backup policy and security configurations. Backup center simplifies data protection management at-scale by enabling you to discover, govern, monitor, operate, and optimize backup management, all from one unified console, helping you to drive operational efficiency with Azure. Security	Azure Backup provides built-in security to your backup environment, both when your data is in transit and at rest by using capabilities encryption, private endpoints, alerts, and so on. Your backups are automatically secured against ransomware, malicious admins, and accidental deletions. How do Recovery Time Objective and Recovery Point Objective work? Recovery Time Objective (RTO) is the target time within which a business process must be restored after a disaster occurs to avoid unacceptable consequences. For instance, if a critical application goes down due to a server failure and the business can only tolerate a maximum of four hours of downtime, then the RTO is four hours. Recovery Point Objective (RPO) is the maximum amount of data loss, measured in time, that your organization can sustain during an event.

"What data is backed up and how? The simplest explanation for Azure Backup is that it backs up data, machine state, and workloads, running on on-premises machines and VM instances to the Azure cloud. Azure Backup stores the backed-up data in Recovery Services vaults and Backup vaults. For on-premises Windows machines, you can back up directly to Azure with the Azure Backup Microsoft Azure Recovery Services (MARS) agent. Alternatively, you can back up these Windows machines to a backup server, perhaps a System Center Data Protection Manager (DPM), or Microsoft Azure Backup Server (MABS). You can then back up that server to a Recovery Services vault in Azure. If you're using Azure VMs, you can back them up directly. Azure Backup installs a backup extension to the Azure VM agent that's running on the VM, which allows backing up the entire VM. If you only want to back up the files and folders on the VM, you can do so by running the MARS agent. Azure Backup stores backed-up data in vaults: Recovery Services vaults and Backup vaults. A vault is an online-storage entity in Azure that's used to hold data such as backup copies, recovery points, and backup policies. Supported backup types
Azure Backup supports full backups and incremental backups. Your initial backup will be a full backup type. The incremental backup is used by DPM/MABS for disk backups, and used in all backups to Azure. As the name suggests, incremental backups only focus on blocks of data that have changed since the previous backup. Azure Backup also supports SQL Server backup types. The following table outlines the support for SQL Server type backups:

Type	Description	Usage
Full	A full database backup backs up the entire database. It contains all the data in a specific database or in a set of filegroups or files. A full backup also contains enough logs to recover that data. At most, you can trigger one full backup per day. You can choose to make a full backup on a daily or weekly interval. Differential	A differential backup is based on the most recent, previous full-data backup. It captures only the data that's changed since the full backup. At most, you can trigger one differential backup per day. You can't configure a full backup and a differential backup on the same day. Multiple backups per day	Back up Azure VMs hourly with a minimum recovery point objective (RPO) of 4 hours and a maximum of 24 hours.","What types of data and workloads can be backed up using Azure Backup, and how is this achieved for on-premises machines versus Azure VMs?","Azure Backup can back up data, machine state, and workloads running on both on-premises machines and VM instances to the Azure cloud. For on-premises Windows machines, backup can be done directly to Azure using the Azure Backup Microsoft Azure Recovery Services (MARS) agent, or indirectly via a backup server like System Center Data Protection Manager (DPM) or Microsoft Azure Backup Server (MABS), which then backs up to a Recovery Services vault in Azure.

At most, you can configure transactional log backups every 15 minutes. Workload integration layer - Backup Extension
A backup extension specific to each workload is installed on the source VM or a worker VM. At the time of backup (as defined by the user in the Backup Policy), the backup extension generates the backup, which could be:

Storage: snapshots when using an Azure VM or Azure Files. Stream backup for databases like SQL or HANA running in VMs. The backup data is eventually transferred to the data plane (Azure Backup managed storage) via secure Azure networks (Network Security Groups (NSG), Firewalls, or more sophisticated private endpoints). Data Plane - Access Tiers

4- When to use Azure Backup

Here, we'll discuss how you can decide if Azure Backup is the right choice for your data protection needs. We'll highlight common backup scenarios where Azure Backup provides benefits, such as:

Ensuring availability of your data. Protecting your Azure workloads. Securing your data. Decision criteria
Azure Backup is an Azure service that provides secure and zero-infrastructure backup solutions for all Azure-managed data assets. It protects a wide range of enterprise workloads, including Azure Virtual Machines, Azure Disks, SQL and SAP databases, Azure file shares and blobs. The main criteria that we're evaluating are outlined in the following table. The table contains some key areas where Azure Backup can provide services to you for data protection. Criteria	Consideration
Azure workloads	Azure VM, Azure Disks, SQL Server, or SAP HANA database running in Azure VM, Azure Blobs, Azure Disks, Azure Database for PostgreSQL. Compliance	Customer-defined backup policy with long-term retention across multiple zones or regions. Operational recoveries	With self-service backup and restores, the application administrator can take care of issues that might arise such as accidental deletion or data corruption. Apply the criteria
In the introduction, we presented a scenario where your organization might have an application that's relying on data from a back-end SQL Server installation. SQL Server is running on three Azure VMs. The data in the backup must be retained for up to 10 years to meet compliance requirements. You also want to be able to monitor the backups. Before we dive into how Azure Backup can help meet these needs, it's important to understand what's not currently supported. If your three Azure VMs are deployed across multiple subscriptions or regions, you should be aware that Azure Backup doesn’t support cross-region backup for most workloads. However, it does support cross-region restore in a paired secondary region. Can Azure Backup protect the Azure VMs hosting the SQL Server instances?",What are some advantages of using the Backup center in Azure for managing backups?,"The Backup center in Azure provides a single pane of glass to manage all tasks related to backups, making it efficient for managing backups across a large and distributed Azure environment.

"Azure Backup is able to back up entire Windows and Linux VMs using backup extensions. As a result, you can back up the entire VM that is hosting SQL Server. If you only want to back up the files, folders, and system state on the Azure VMs, you can use the Microsoft Azure Recovery Services (MARS) agent. If your main concern is to only back up the SQL Server data, Azure Backup provides support for that as well. Azure Backup offers a stream-based, specialized solution to back up SQL Servers running in Azure VMs. This solution aligns with Azure Backup's benefits of zero-infrastructure backup, long-term retention, and central management. Additionally, Azure Backup provides the following advantages specifically for SQL Server:

Workload aware backups that support all backup types: full, differential, and log

"Things to know about backup options for virtual machines
Let's examine four options for backing up your virtual machines: Azure Backup, Azure Site Recovery, and Azure managed disks snapshots and images. The following table summarizes these options and provides scenarios for using the different methods. As you review these options, think about which method can support the requirements for the business scenario presented in this module. Azure backup option	Configuration scenarios	Description
Azure Backup	Back up Azure virtual machines running production workloads

Create application-consistent backups for both Windows and Linux virtual machines	Azure Backup takes a snapshot of your virtual machine and stores the data as recovery points in geo-redundant recovery vaults. When you restore from a recovery point, you can restore your entire virtual machine or specific files only. Azure Site Recovery	Quickly and easily recover specific applications

Replicate to the Azure region of your choice	Azure Site Recovery protects your virtual machines from a major disaster scenario when a whole region experiences an outage due to a major natural disaster or widespread service interruption. Azure managed disks - snapshot	Quickly and easily back up your virtual machines that use Azure managed disks at any point in time

Support development and test environments	An Azure managed disks snapshot is a read-only full copy of a managed disk stored as a standard managed disk by default. A snapshot exists independent of the source disk and can be used to create new managed disks. Each snapshot is billed based on the actual size used. If you create a snapshot of a managed disk with a capacity of 64 GB used only 10 GB, Azure bills you for 10 GB. Azure managed disks - image	Create an image from your custom virtual hard disk (VHD) in an Azure storage account or directly from a generalized (via Sysprep) virtual machine

Create hundreds of virtual machines by using your custom image without copying or managing any storage account	Azure managed disks also support creating a managed custom image. This process captures a single image that contains all managed disks associated with a virtual machine, including both the operating system and data disks. Things to consider when creating images versus snapshots
It's important to understand the differences and benefits of creating an image and a snapshot backup of an Azure managed disk. Consider images.

When you restore from a recovery point, you can restore your entire virtual machine or specific files only. Azure Site Recovery	Quickly and easily recover specific applications

Replicate to the Azure region of your choice	Azure Site Recovery protects your virtual machines from a major disaster scenario when a whole region experiences an outage due to a major natural disaster or widespread service interruption. Azure managed disks - snapshot	Quickly and easily back up your virtual machines that use Azure managed disks at any point in time

Support development and test environments	An Azure managed disks snapshot is a read-only full copy of a managed disk stored as a standard managed disk by default. A snapshot exists independent of the source disk and can be used to create new managed disks. Each snapshot is billed based on the actual size used. If you create a snapshot of a managed disk with a capacity of 64 GB used only 10 GB, Azure bills you for 10 GB. Azure managed disks - image	Create an image from your custom virtual hard disk (VHD) in an Azure storage account or directly from a generalized (via Sysprep) virtual machine

Create hundreds of virtual machines by using your custom image without copying or managing any storage account	Azure managed disks also support creating a managed custom image. This process captures a single image that contains all managed disks associated with a virtual machine, including both the operating system and data disks. Things to consider when creating images versus snapshots
It's important to understand the differences and benefits of creating an image and a snapshot backup of an Azure managed disk. Consider images. With Azure managed disks, you can take an image of a generalized, deallocated virtual machine. The image includes all of the disks attached to the virtual machine. You can use the image to create a virtual machine that includes all of the disks. Consider snapshots.",What is the difference between using Azure managed disks snapshots and images for virtual machine backups?,"Snapshots are read-only full copies of a managed disk, used for quick backups and support for development and test environments, and are billed based on actual data size used. Images, on the other hand, are used to create a managed custom image from a generalized virtual machine, capturing all associated disks, and are ideal for creating multiple virtual machines without managing storage accounts."
"A snapshot is a copy of a disk at the point in time the snapshot is taken. The snapshot applies to one disk only, and doesn't have awareness of any disk other than the one it contains. Snapshot backups are problematic for configurations that require the coordination of multiple disks, such as striping. In this case, the snapshots need to coordinate with each other, but this functionality isn't currently supported. Consider operating disk backups. If you have a virtual machine with only one disk (the operating system disk), you can take a snapshot or an image of the disk. You can create a virtual machine from either a snapshot or an image.

3- Create virtual machine snapshots in Azure Backup

An Azure Backup job creates a snapshot for your virtual machine in two phases:

Phase 1: Take a snapshot of the virtual machine data

Phase 2: Transfer the snapshot to an Azure Recovery Services vault

The following diagram highlights this process. Illustration that shows the Azure Backup job process for a virtual machine as described in the text. After the Azure Backup job completes, you can use recovery points for the snapshot to restore your virtual machine or specific files. Things to know about snapshots and recovery points
Let's take a closer look at the characteristics of snapshots and recovery points in Azure Backup. By default, Azure Backup keeps snapshots for two days to reduce backup and restore times. The local retention reduces the time required to transform and copy data back from an Azure Recovery Services vault. You can set the default snapshot retention value from one to five days. Incremental snapshots are stored as Azure page blobs (Azure Disks). Recovery points for a virtual machine snapshot are available only after both phases of the Azure Backup job are complete. Recovery points are listed for the virtual machine snapshot in the Azure portal and are labeled with a recovery point type. After a snapshot is first taken, the recovery points are identified with the snapshot recovery point type. After the snapshot is transferred to an Azure Recovery Services vault, the recovery point type changes to snapshot and vault. Things to consider when using snapshots and recovery points
Here are some important benefits and considerations about using snapshots and recovery points. Consider recovery after Phase 1. To restore your virtual machine from the snapshot, use the snapshot captured in Phase 1 of the Azure Backup job. Phase 2 transfers the snapshot to the Recovery Services vault, so recovery points can be created. You don't have to wait for Phase 2 to complete before attempting a full restore from the snapshot.",What challenges are associated with using snapshots for configurations involving multiple disks?,"Snapshots are problematic for configurations that require the coordination of multiple disks, such as striping, because they lack the functionality to coordinate with each other."

"The vault must be created within your Azure subscription, and in the region where you want to store the data. You also need to specify how you want your storage replicated, either geo-redundant (default) or locally redundant. Geo-redundant (GRS): (Default) Use GRS when Azure is your primary backup storage endpoint. Locally redundant (LRS): If Azure isn't your primary backup storage endpoint, use LRS to reduce your storage costs. Step 2: Define your backup policy options
After you create your vault, you need to define your backup policy. The policy specifies when to take the data snapshots, and how long to keep the snapshots. Your virtual machine is protected by taking snapshots of your data at defined intervals. The snapshots produce recovery points that are stored in your Recovery Services vault. If it becomes necessary to repair or rebuild your virtual machine, you can restore your machine by using your saved recovery points. In your backup policy, you can specify to trigger a backup from one to five times per day. Step 3: Back up your virtual machine

"The nature of the resource defines which data types are available. A data type can be a metric, a log, or both a metric and a log:

The focus for metric-based data types is the numerical time-sensitive values that represent some aspect of the target resource. The focus for log-based data types is the querying of content data held in structured, record-based log files that are relevant to the target resource. Diagram that represents the target resources feeding into Azure Monitor and the two principal signal types: metrics and logs. You'll learn about the three signal types that you can use to monitor your environment:

Metric alerts provide an alert trigger when a specified threshold is exceeded. For example, a metric alert can notify you when CPU usage is greater than 95 percent. Activity log alerts notify you when Azure resources change state. For example, an activity log alert can notify you when a resource is deleted. Log alerts are based on things written to log files. For example, a log alert can notify you when a web server has returned a number of 404 or 500 responses. Composition of an alert rule
Every alert or notification available in Azure Monitor is the product of a rule. Some of these rules are built into the Azure platform. You can use alert rules to create custom alerts and notifications. No matter which target resource or data source you use, the composition of an alert rule remains the same. RESOURCE
The target resource for the alert rule. You can assign multiple target resources to a single alert rule. The type of resource defines the available signal types. CONDITION

3- Use metric alerts for alerts about performance issues in your Azure environment

Azure Monitor can use thresholds to monitor specific resources. In an organization, it's far more useful to be notified when the free disk space on a server is less than five percent instead of being alerted every time a file is saved. As a solution architect, you want to implement regular threshold monitoring for many of your target resources and instances. Monitoring helps to head off potential issues before they can affect your customers. In this unit, you'll investigate the different kinds of metric alerts that Azure Monitor supports.

These data types help in identifying various conditions that require attention, allowing timely notifications and interventions."
"Metric alerts can be useful if, for instance, you need to know when your server CPU utilization is reaching a critical threshold of 90 percent. You can receive alerts when your database storage is getting too low, or when network latency is about to reach unacceptable levels. Composition of a metric alert
As you learned in the previous unit, all alerts are governed by their rules. For metric alerts, there's another factor to define: the condition type. It can be static or dynamic. You must define the type of statistical analysis to be used with either static or dynamic metric alerts. Example types are minimum, maximum, average, and total. In this example, you define the period of data to be assessed: the last 10 minutes. Finally, you set the frequency by which the alert conditions are checked: every two minutes. Use static threshold metric alerts
Static metric alerts are based on simple static conditions and thresholds that you define. With static metrics, you specify the threshold that's used to trigger the alert or notification. In the previously defined scenario, a static alert with a threshold of 85 percent CPU utilization checks the rule every two minutes. It evaluates the last 10 minutes of CPU utilization data to assess if it rises above the threshold. If the evaluation is true, the alert triggers the actions associated with the action group. Use dynamic threshold metric alerts
Dynamic metric alerts use machine-learning tools that Azure provides to automatically improve the accuracy of the thresholds defined by the initial rule. There's no hard threshold in dynamic metrics. However, you'll need to define two more parameters:

The look-back period defines how many previous periods need to be evaluated. For example, if you set the look-back period to 3, then in the example used here, the assessed data range would be 30 minutes (three sets of 10 minutes). The number of violations expresses how many times the logic condition has to deviate from the expected behavior before the alert rule fires a notification. In this example, if you set the number of violations to two, the alert would be triggered after two deviations from the calculated threshold. Understand dimensions
Until now, the assessed metric alerts have focused on a single target instance. Azure Monitor supports dimensions, which enable monitoring data to be supplied from multiple target instances. You can use dimensions to define one metric alert rule and have it applied to multiple related instances. For example, you can monitor CPU utilization across all the servers running your app. You can then receive an individual notification for each server instance when the rule conditions are triggered.",What are the key components that must be defined when setting up a metric alert in Azure Monitor?,"The key components include the condition type, which can be static or dynamic, and the type of statistical analysis such as minimum, maximum, average, or total. You also need to define the period of data to be assessed and the frequency by which the alert conditions are checked."

For example, you can monitor CPU utilization across all the servers running your app. You can then receive an individual notification for each server instance when the rule conditions are triggered.",How do static threshold metric alerts differ from dynamic threshold metric alerts?,"Static threshold metric alerts are based on pre-defined static conditions and thresholds, whereas dynamic threshold metric alerts use machine-learning tools to automatically adjust thresholds. Static alerts use a fixed threshold, while dynamic alerts involve parameters like look-back period and number of violations to determine when to trigger an alert."
"Metric alerts can be useful if, for instance, you need to know when your server CPU utilization is reaching a critical threshold of 90 percent. You can receive alerts when your database storage is getting too low, or when network latency is about to reach unacceptable levels. Composition of a metric alert
As you learned in the previous unit, all alerts are governed by their rules. For metric alerts, there's another factor to define: the condition type. It can be static or dynamic. You must define the type of statistical analysis to be used with either static or dynamic metric alerts. Example types are minimum, maximum, average, and total. In this example, you define the period of data to be assessed: the last 10 minutes. Finally, you set the frequency by which the alert conditions are checked: every two minutes. Use static threshold metric alerts
Static metric alerts are based on simple static conditions and thresholds that you define. With static metrics, you specify the threshold that's used to trigger the alert or notification. In the previously defined scenario, a static alert with a threshold of 85 percent CPU utilization checks the rule every two minutes. It evaluates the last 10 minutes of CPU utilization data to assess if it rises above the threshold. If the evaluation is true, the alert triggers the actions associated with the action group. Use dynamic threshold metric alerts
Dynamic metric alerts use machine-learning tools that Azure provides to automatically improve the accuracy of the thresholds defined by the initial rule. There's no hard threshold in dynamic metrics. However, you'll need to define two more parameters:

The look-back period defines how many previous periods need to be evaluated. For example, if you set the look-back period to 3, then in the example used here, the assessed data range would be 30 minutes (three sets of 10 minutes). The number of violations expresses how many times the logic condition has to deviate from the expected behavior before the alert rule fires a notification. In this example, if you set the number of violations to two, the alert would be triggered after two deviations from the calculated threshold. Understand dimensions
Until now, the assessed metric alerts have focused on a single target instance. Azure Monitor supports dimensions, which enable monitoring data to be supplied from multiple target instances. You can use dimensions to define one metric alert rule and have it applied to multiple related instances. For example, you can monitor CPU utilization across all the servers running your app. You can then receive an individual notification for each server instance when the rule conditions are triggered.",How can dimensions be utilized in Azure Monitor for metric alerts?,"Dimensions can be used to monitor data from multiple target instances under a single metric alert rule. They enable you to receive individual notifications for each instance when the rule conditions are triggered, such as monitoring CPU utilization across all servers running an application."
"You can define the dimensions by naming each target instance specifically, or you can define the dimensions by using the asterisk (*) wildcard, which uses all available instances. Scale metric alerts
Azure Monitor supports creating metric alerts that, like dimensions, monitor multiple resources. Scaling is currently limited to Azure virtual machines. However, a single metric alert can monitor resources in one Azure region. Creating scaling metric alert rules to monitor multiple resources is no different than creating any other metric alert rule; you just select all the resources that you want to monitor. Like dimensions, a scaling metric alert is individual to the resource that triggered it. Next unit: Exercise - Use metric alerts to alert on performance issues in your Azure environment

"By its nature, log data is historical, so usage is focused on analytics and trends. You can use these types of logs to assess if any of your servers have exceeded their CPU utilization by a given threshold during the last 30 minutes, or you can evaluate response codes issued on your web application server in the last hour. How log alerts work
Log alerts behave in a slightly different way than other alert mechanisms. The first part of a log alert defines the log search rule. The rule defines how often it should run, the time period under evaluation, and the query to be run. When a log search evaluates as positive, it creates an alert record and triggers any associated actions. Composition of log search rules
Every log alert has an associated search rule. The composition of these rules is as follows:

Log query: Query that runs every time the alert rule fires
Time period: Time range for the query
Frequency: How often the query should run
Threshold: Trigger point for an alert to be created
Log search results are one of two types: number of records or metric measurement. Number of records
Consider using the number-of-records type of log search when you're working with an event or event-driven data. Examples are syslog and web-app responses. This type of log search returns a single alert when the number of records in a search result reaches or exceeds the value for the number of records (threshold). For example, when the threshold for the search rule is greater or equal to five, the query results have to return five or more rows of data before the alert is triggered. Metric measurement
Metric measurement logs offer the same basic functionality as metric alert logs. Unlike number-of-records search logs, metric measurement logs require additional criteria to be set:

Aggregate function: The calculation that will be made against the result data. An example is count or average. The result of the function is called AggregatedValue. Group field: A field by which the result will be grouped. This criterion is used with the aggregated value. For example, you might specify that you want the average grouped by computer. Interval: The time interval by which data is aggregated. For example, if you specify 10 minutes, an alert record is created for each aggregated block of 10 minutes. Threshold: A point defined by an aggregated value and the total number of breaches. Consider using this type of alert when you need to add a level of tolerance to the results found.",How do log alerts differ from other alert mechanisms?,"Log alerts differ from other alert mechanisms in that they begin with a log search rule, which defines how often the query should run, the time period under evaluation, and the specific query to be executed.

This type of log search returns a single alert when the number of records in a search result reaches or exceeds the value for the number of records (threshold). For example, when the threshold for the search rule is greater or equal to five, the query results have to return five or more rows of data before the alert is triggered. Metric measurement
Metric measurement logs offer the same basic functionality as metric alert logs. Unlike number-of-records search logs, metric measurement logs require additional criteria to be set:

Aggregate function: The calculation that will be made against the result data. An example is count or average. The result of the function is called AggregatedValue. Group field: A field by which the result will be grouped. This criterion is used with the aggregated value. For example, you might specify that you want the average grouped by computer. Interval: The time interval by which data is aggregated. For example, if you specify 10 minutes, an alert record is created for each aggregated block of 10 minutes. Threshold: A point defined by an aggregated value and the total number of breaches. Consider using this type of alert when you need to add a level of tolerance to the results found.",When would you use a metric measurement log search over a number-of-records log search?,"You would use a metric measurement log search over a number-of-records log search when you need to perform calculations against the result data, such as counting or averaging, and when you want to add a level of tolerance to the results. Metric measurement logs require additional criteria like aggregate functions, group fields, intervals, and thresholds, making them suitable for more complex data analysis."
"One use for this type of alert is to respond if a particular trend or pattern is found. For example, if the number of breaches is five, and any server in your group exceeds 85 percent CPU utilization more than five times within the given time period, an alert fires. As you can see, metric measurements greatly reduce the volume of alerts that are produced. Still, give careful consideration when you're setting the threshold parameters to avoid missing critical alerts. Stateless nature of log alerts
One of the primary considerations when you're evaluating the use of log alerts is that they're stateless (stateful log alerts are currently in preview). A stateless log alert will generate new alerts every time the rule criteria are triggered, regardless of whether the alert was previously recorded.

6- Use activity log alerts to alert on events within your Azure infrastructure

Activity log alerts allow you to be notified when a specific event happens on some Azure resource. For example, you can be notified when someone creates a new VM in a subscription. An activity log can also include alerts for Azure service health. A company can get notifications when service issues or planned maintenance happens on the Azure platform. As an Azure solution architect, you want to explore the capability to monitor selected Azure resources within your subscription. You'll understand how you can use the resources to improve your team's responsiveness and the stability of your systems. In this unit, you'll explore the two different kinds of activity log alerts. Now that you've seen all the different kinds of alerts you can use in Azure Monitor, you'll see how you can trigger actions for your alerts. Actions might include sending an email or creating an IT Service Management (ITSM) support ticket. When to use activity log alerts
So far, you've seen two different types of alerts supported in Azure Monitor. Metric alerts are ideally suited to monitoring for threshold breaches or spotting trends; Log alerts allow for greater analytical monitoring of historical data. Activity log alerts are designed to work with Azure resources. Typically, you'd create this type of log to receive notifications when specific changes occur on a resource within your Azure subscription. There are two types of activity log alerts:

Specific operations: Applies to resources within your Azure subscription, and often has a scope with specific resources or a resource group.

'Specific operations' alerts apply to changes on specific resources within your Azure subscription, such as when a VM is deleted, while 'General operations' alerts are broader and may include notifications for service health issues or maintenance events."
"Service health events: Include notice of incidents and maintenance of target resources. Composition of an activity log alert
It's important to note that activity log alerts will monitor events only in the subscription where the log alert was created. Activity log alerts are based on events. The best approach for defining them is to use Azure Monitor to filter all the events in your subscription until you find the one that you want. To begin the creation process, you'll then select Add activity log alert. Like the previous alerts, activity log alerts have their own attributes:

"Next unit: Use action groups and alert processing rules to send notifications when an alert is fired



7-  Use action groups and alert processing rules to send notifications when an alert is fired

When an alert is fired, Azure Monitor, Azure Service Health, and Azure Advisor use action groups to notify users about the alert and take an action. An action group is a collection of notification preferences and actions that are executed when the alert is fired. You can run one or more actions for each triggered alert. Azure Monitor can perform any of the following actions:

Send an email
Send an SMS message
Create an Azure app push notification
Make a voice call to a number
Call an Azure function
Trigger a logic app
Send a notification to a webhook
Create an ITSM ticket
Use a runbook (to restart a VM or scale a VM up or down)
Once you've created an action group, you can reuse that action group as often as you want. For example, after you've created an action to email your company's operations team, you can add that action group to all service-health events. While you're creating the alert rule, you can either create a new action group or add an existing action group to the alert rule. You can also edit an existing alert to add an action group. Alert processing rules
Use alert processing rules to override the normal behavior of a fired alert by adding or suppressing an action group. You can use alert processing rules to add action groups or remove (suppress) action groups from your fired alerts. Alert processing rules are different from alert rules. Alert rules trigger alerts when a condition is met in your monitored resources. Alert processing rules modify the alerts as they're being fired. You can use alert processing rules to:

Suppress notifications during planned maintenance windows. Implement management at scale, by specifying commonly used logic in a single rule, instead of having to set it consistently in all your alert rules. Add an action group to all alert types. You can apply alert processing rules to different resource scopes, from a single resource, or to an entire subscription. You can also use them to apply various filters or have the rule work on a predefined schedule. You can control when the alert processing rule applies. By default the rule is always active, but you can select a one-time window for this rule to apply, or you can have set a recurrence such as a weekly recurrence.",What is the purpose of action groups in Azure Monitor when an alert is fired?,"Action groups in Azure Monitor are used to notify users about an alert and take an action when the alert is fired.

"At the center of the diagram are the data stores for metrics and logs. On the right are the functions that Azure Monitor performs with this collected data, such as analysis, alerting, and streaming to external systems. Diagram of Azure Monitor's architecture, displaying the sources of monitoring data, the data stores, and functions performed on the data. Azure Monitor collects data automatically from a range of components. For example:

Application data: Data that relates to your custom application code. Operating-system data: Data from the Windows or Linux virtual machines that host your application. Azure resource data: Data that relates to the operations of an Azure resource, such as a web app or a load balancer. Azure subscription data: Data that relates to your subscription. It includes data about Azure health and availability. Azure tenant data: Data about your Azure organization-level services, such as Microsoft Entra ID. Because Azure Monitor is an automatic system, it begins to collect data from these sources as soon as you create Azure resources like virtual machines and web apps. You can extend the data that Azure Monitor collects by:

Enabling diagnostics: For some resources, such as Azure SQL Databases, you'll receive full information about a resource only after you've enabled diagnostic logging for it. You can use the Azure portal, the Azure CLI, or PowerShell to enable diagnostics. Adding an agent: For virtual machines, you can install the Log Analytics agent and configure it to send data to a Log Analytics workspace. This agent increases the amount of information that's sent to Azure Monitor. Your developers might also want to send data to Azure Monitor from custom code, such as a web app, an Azure function, or a mobile app. They send data by calling the Data Collector API. You can communicate with this REST interface through HTTP. This interface is compatible with various development frameworks, such as .NET Framework, Node.js, and Python. Developers can choose their favorite language and framework to log data in Azure Monitor. Logs
Logs contain time-stamped information about resource changes. The type of information recorded varies by log source. The log data is organized into records, with different sets of properties for each type of record. The logs can include numeric values like Azure Monitor metrics, but most include text data rather than numeric values. The most common type of log entry records an event. Events can occur sporadically rather than at fixed intervals or according to a schedule. Events are created by applications and services, which provide the context for the events.",What are the primary data sources that Azure Monitor collects data from automatically?,"Azure Monitor collects data automatically from application data, operating-system data, Azure resource data, Azure subscription data, and Azure tenant data as soon as Azure resources like virtual machines and web apps are created."

"You can store metric data in logs to combine them with other monitoring data for analysis. You can log data from Azure Monitor in a Log Analytics workspace. Azure provides an analysis engine and a rich query language. The logs show the context of any problems, and are useful for identifying root causes. Screenshot of an example query against Azure logs with the query text on top and a graph displaying the results below. Metrics
Metrics are numerical values that describe some aspect of a system at a point in time. Azure Monitor can capture metrics in near-real time. The metrics are collected at regular intervals, and are useful for alerting because of their frequent sampling. You can use various algorithms to compare a metric to other metrics and observe trends over time. Metrics are stored in a time-series database. This data store is most effective for analyzing time-stamped data. Metrics are suited for alerting and fast detection of issues. They can tell you about system performance. If needed, you can combine them with logs to identify the root cause of issues. Screenshot of an example chart in Azure Metrics displaying average CPU percentage. Analyzing logs by using Kusto
To retrieve, consolidate, and analyze data, you can specify a query to run in Azure Monitor logs. You can write a log query with the Kusto query language, which Azure Data Explorer also uses. You can test log queries in the Azure portal so you can work with them interactively. You'll typically start with basic queries, then progress to more advanced functions as your requirements become more complex. In the Azure portal, you can create custom dashboards, which are targeted displays of resources and data. You can build each dashboard from a set of tiles. Each tile might show a set of resources, a chart, a data table, or some custom text. Azure Monitor provides tiles that you can add to dashboards; for example, you might use a tile to display the results of a Kusto query in a dashboard. In the example scenario, the operations team can consolidate its monitoring data by visualizing it in charts and tables. These tools are effective for summarizing data and presenting it to different audiences. By using Azure dashboards, you can combine various kinds of data, including both logs and metrics, into a single pane in the Azure portal. For example, you might want to create a dashboard that combines tiles that show a graph of metrics, a table of activity logs, charts from Azure Monitor, and the output of a log query.

Azure provides an analysis engine and a rich query language. The logs show the context of any problems, and are useful for identifying root causes. Screenshot of an example query against Azure logs with the query text on top and a graph displaying the results below. Metrics
Metrics are numerical values that describe some aspect of a system at a point in time. Azure Monitor can capture metrics in near-real time. The metrics are collected at regular intervals, and are useful for alerting because of their frequent sampling. You can use various algorithms to compare a metric to other metrics and observe trends over time. Metrics are stored in a time-series database. This data store is most effective for analyzing time-stamped data. Metrics are suited for alerting and fast detection of issues. They can tell you about system performance. If needed, you can combine them with logs to identify the root cause of issues. Screenshot of an example chart in Azure Metrics displaying average CPU percentage. Analyzing logs by using Kusto
To retrieve, consolidate, and analyze data, you can specify a query to run in Azure Monitor logs. You can write a log query with the Kusto query language, which Azure Data Explorer also uses. You can test log queries in the Azure portal so you can work with them interactively. You'll typically start with basic queries, then progress to more advanced functions as your requirements become more complex. In the Azure portal, you can create custom dashboards, which are targeted displays of resources and data. You can build each dashboard from a set of tiles. Each tile might show a set of resources, a chart, a data table, or some custom text. Azure Monitor provides tiles that you can add to dashboards; for example, you might use a tile to display the results of a Kusto query in a dashboard. In the example scenario, the operations team can consolidate its monitoring data by visualizing it in charts and tables. These tools are effective for summarizing data and presenting it to different audiences. By using Azure dashboards, you can combine various kinds of data, including both logs and metrics, into a single pane in the Azure portal. For example, you might want to create a dashboard that combines tiles that show a graph of metrics, a table of activity logs, charts from Azure Monitor, and the output of a log query.

You can use the Kusto Query Language to query log information for your services running in Azure. A Kusto query is a read-only request to process data and return results. You'll state the query in plain text by using a data-flow model that's designed to make the syntax easy to read, write, and automate. The query uses schema entities that are organized in a hierarchy similar to that of Azure SQL Database: databases, tables, and columns. A Kusto query consists of a sequence of query statements, delimited by a semicolon (;). At least one statement is a tabular expression statement. A tabular expression statement formats the data arranged as a table of columns and rows. A tabular expression statement's syntax has a tabular data flow from one tabular query operator to another, starting with a data source. A data source might be a table in a database or an operator that produces data. The data then flows through a set of data-transformation operators that are bound together with the pipe (|) delimiter. For example, the following Kusto query has a single tabular expression statement. The statement starts with a reference to a table called Events.

In this module, you learned how to use Azure Monitor. You looked at Azure Monitor logs to extract valuable information about your infrastructure from log data by using queries, and you performed these queries by using the Kusto query language. You learned how to:

Explore the types of data that Azure Monitor collects.",What steps should be taken to ensure a query runs correctly in Azure Monitor's Logs pane?,"To ensure a query runs correctly, you should clear the scratchpad before opening or adding a new query to run. This prevents any existing query code from interfering with the new query. After selecting a predefined query, the query code is appended to the scratchpad, so clearing it beforehand is essential for accurate results."
"Here, in the drop-down list in the left menu, you can view a list of the sample queries grouped by Category, Query type, Resource type, Solution, or Topic. Select Category in the drop-down list, and then select IT & Management Tools. In the search box, enter Distinct missing updates cross computers. Select the query in the left pane, then select Run. The Logs pane reappears, with the query returning a list of Windows updates missing from virtual machines that are sending logs to the workspace. Note

You can also run this same query from the Logs pane. In the left pane, select the Queries tab, then select Category in the Group by dropdown list. Now scroll down the list, expand IT & Management Tools, and double-click Distinct missing updates cross computers. Select Run to run the query. When you select a predefined query in the left pane, the query code is appended to whatever query exists in the scratchpad. Remember to clear the scratchpad before opening or adding a new query to run. In the left pane, clear the search box. Select Queries, then select Category in the Group by dropdown list. Expand Azure Monitor, and double-click Computers availability today. Select Run. This query creates a time series chart with the number of unique IP addresses sending logs into the workspace each hour for the last day. Select Topic in the Group by dropdown list, scroll down to expand Function App, and then double-click Show application logs from Function Apps. Select Run. This query returns a list of application logs, sorted by time with the latest logs shown first. You'll notice that from the Kusto queries you used here, it's easy to target a query to a specific time window, event level, or event log type. The security team can easily examine heartbeats to identify when servers are unavailable, which might indicate a denial-of-service attack. If the team spots the time when a server was unavailable, it can query for events in the security log around that time to diagnose whether an attack caused the interruption. Additionally, predefined queries can also evaluate VM availability, identify missing Windows updates, and review firewall logs to view denied network flows intended for the VMs of interest.
