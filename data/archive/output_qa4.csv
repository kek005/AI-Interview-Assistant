Next unit: Review Azure Resource Manager benefits

1- Review Azure Resource Manager benefits

The infrastructure for your application is typically made up of many components – maybe a virtual machine, storage account, and virtual network, or a web app, database, database server, and third-party services.","1. **Question:** What are the primary functions of Azure Resource Manager, and how can it help prevent the accidental deletion of critical resources?","Azure Resource Manager (ARM) is a service in Microsoft Azure that provides a way to manage and organize Azure resources. Its primary functions include deploying, managing, and monitoring Azure resources through a consistent management layer. ARM helps prevent the accidental deletion of critical resources by allowing the use of resource locks, which can be applied to resources or resource groups to prevent modifications or deletions. Additionally, it provides a structured approach to organizing resources using resource groups, which makes it easier to manage ownership and access permissions, thus reducing the risk of inadvertent deletions.

2. **Question:** How does the use of resource groups in Azure Resource Manager enhance resource organization and management within an organization?"
"These components are not separate entities, instead they are related and interdependent parts of a single entity. You want to deploy, manage, and monitor them as a group. Azure Resource Manager enables you to work with the resources in your solution as a group. You can deploy, update, or delete all the resources for your solution in a single, coordinated operation. You use a template for deployment and that template can work for different environments such as testing, staging, and production. Azure Resource Manager provides security, auditing, and tagging features to help you manage your resources after deployment. Consistent management layer
Azure Resource Manager provides a consistent management layer to perform tasks through Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI, Azure portal, REST API, and client SDKs. Choose the tools and APIs that work best for you. The following image shows how all the tools interact with the same Azure Resource Manager API. The API passes requests to the Azure Resource Manager service, which authenticates and authorizes the requests. Azure Resource Manager then routes the requests to the appropriate resource providers. Diagram of the Resource Manager request model. Benefits
Azure Resource Manager provides several benefits:

You can deploy, manage, and monitor all the resources for your solution as a group, rather than handling these resources individually. You can repeatedly deploy your solution throughout the development lifecycle and have confidence your resources are deployed in a consistent state. You can manage your infrastructure through declarative templates rather than scripts. You can define the dependencies between resources so they're deployed in the correct order. You can apply access control to all services in your resource group because Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is natively integrated into the management platform. You can apply tags to resources to logically organize all the resources in your subscription. You can clarify your organization's billing by viewing costs for a group of resources sharing the same tag. Guidance
The following suggestions help you take full advantage of Azure Resource Manager when working with your solutions. Define and deploy your infrastructure through the declarative syntax in Azure Resource Manager templates, rather than through imperative commands. Define all deployment and configuration steps in the template. You should have no manual steps for setting up your solution. Run imperative commands to manage your resources, such as to start or stop an app or machine. Arrange resources with the same lifecycle in a resource group. Use tags for all other organizing of resources. Next unit: Review Azure resource terminology

2- Review Azure resource terminology

If you're new to Azure Resource Manager, there are some terms you might not be familiar with.",1. **Question:** How does Azure Resource Manager enhance the deployment and management of resources in a cloud environment?,"Azure Resource Manager enhances the deployment and management of resources by enabling you to work with them as a group rather than individually. This allows for coordinated operations such as deploying, updating, or deleting all resources for a solution in a single action. Azure Resource Manager uses templates for deployment, which can be applied across different environments like testing, staging, and production, ensuring consistency. This management is further supported by features like security, auditing, and tagging, which aid in post-deployment resource management.

2. **Question:** What are the advantages of using Azure Resource Manager's declarative templates compared to imperative scripts?"
"resource - A manageable item that is available through Azure. Some common resources are a virtual machine, storage account, web app, database, and virtual network, but there are many more. resource group - A container that holds related resources for an Azure solution. The resource group can include all the resources for the solution, or only those resources that you want to manage as a group. You decide how you want to allocate resources to resource groups based on what makes the most sense for your organization. resource provider - A service that supplies the resources you can deploy and manage through Resource Manager. Each resource provider offers operations for working with the resources that are deployed. Some common resource providers are Microsoft.Compute, which supplies the virtual machine resource, Microsoft.Storage, which supplies the storage account resource, and Microsoft.Web, which supplies resources related to web apps. template - A JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file that defines one or more resources to deploy to a resource group. It also defines the dependencies between the deployed resources. The template can be used to deploy the resources consistently and repeatedly. declarative syntax - Syntax that lets you state ""Here is what I intend to create"" without having to write the sequence of programming commands to create it. The Resource Manager template is an example of declarative syntax. In the file, you define the properties for the infrastructure to deploy to Azure. Resource providers
Each resource provider offers a set of resources and operations for working with an Azure service. For example, if you want to store keys and secrets, you work with the Microsoft.KeyVault resource provider. This resource provider offers a resource type called vaults for creating the key vault. The name of a resource type is in the format: {resource-provider}/{resource-type}. For example, the key vault type is Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults. Note

Before deploying your resources, you should gain an understanding of the available resource providers. Knowing the names of resource providers and resources helps you define resources you want to deploy to Azure. Also, you need to know the valid locations and API versions for each resource type. Next unit: Create resource groups

3- Create resource groups

Resources can be deployed to any new or existing resource group. Deployment of resources to a resource group becomes a job where you can track the template execution. If deployment fails, the output of the job can describe why the deployment failed. Whether the deployment is a single resource to a group or a template to a group, you can use the information to fix any errors and redeploy.","1:
**What are the roles of resource groups in Azure, and how can they be effectively utilized within an organization?**","Resource groups in Azure serve as containers that hold related resources for an Azure solution. They can include all the resources needed for a particular solution or only those resources that you wish to manage collectively. The primary role of a resource group is to provide an easy way to manage, deploy, and monitor resources as a single entity. An organization can effectively utilize resource groups by organizing them based on department, project, or any logical grouping that aligns with their business needs. This approach simplifies management tasks such as applying policies, monitoring costs, and accessing resources. By using resource groups strategically, organizations can streamline resource management and ensure consistency across deployments."

**Can you explain how Azure Resource Manager templates use declarative syntax, and why this is beneficial for deploying resources?**","Azure Resource Manager templates use a declarative syntax, which means that you define what resources you want to create without having to specify the sequence of commands to create them. In a Resource Manager template, which is a JSON file, you define the properties for the infrastructure you wish to deploy. The template allows you to specify resource types, names, locations, and other configuration settings. The benefits of using declarative syntax include consistency and repeatability in deployments, as it ensures that resources are deployed in the exact configuration defined in the template. This method also reduces the potential for human error and allows for easier updates and scaling of deployments since you can modify the template and redeploy as needed."

**What is the significance of understanding resource providers in Azure, and how does it impact resource deployment?**","Understanding resource providers in Azure is crucial because they are the services that supply the resources you can deploy and manage through Azure Resource Manager. Each resource provider offers a set of resources and operations related to a specific Azure service. For instance, Microsoft.Compute provides virtual machines, while Microsoft.Storage provides storage accounts. Knowing the available resource providers and their resource types is essential for defining the resources you want to deploy on Azure. It impacts resource deployment by ensuring you select the correct provider and resource type for your needs, understand the operations available, and are aware of the valid locations and API versions for each resource type. This knowledge helps in accurately setting up and managing your Azure infrastructure efficiently."
"Deployments are incremental; if a resource group contains two web apps and you decide to deploy a third, the existing web apps will not be removed. Considerations
Resource Groups are at their simplest a logical collection of resources. There are a few rules for resource groups. Resources can only exist in one resource group. Resource Groups cannot be renamed. Resource Groups can have resources of many different types (services). Resource Groups can have resources from many different regions. Creating resource groups
There are some important factors to consider when defining your resource group:

All the resources in your group should share the same lifecycle. You deploy, update, and delete them together. If one resource, such as a database server, needs to exist on a different deployment cycle it should be in another resource group. Each resource can only exist in one resource group. You can add or remove a resource to a resource group at any time. You can move a resource from one resource group to another group. Limitations do apply to moving resources. A resource group can contain resources that reside in different regions. A resource group can be used to scope access control for administrative actions. A resource can interact with resources in other resource groups. This interaction is common when the two resources are related but don't share the same lifecycle (for example, web apps connecting to a database). When creating a resource group, you need to provide a location for that resource group. You may be wondering, ""Why does a resource group need a location? And, if the resources can have different locations than the resource group, why does the resource group location matter at all?"" The resource group stores metadata about the resources. Therefore, when you specify a location for the resource group, you're specifying where that metadata is stored. For compliance reasons, you may need to ensure that your data is stored in a particular region. Note

By scoping permissions to a resource group, you can add/remove and modify resources easily without having to recreate assignments and scopes. Next unit: Create Azure Resource Manager locks

4- Create Azure Resource Manager locks

A common concern with resources provisioned in Azure is the ease with which they can be deleted. An over-zealous or careless administrator can accidentally erase months of work with a few steps. Resource Manager locks allow organizations to put a structure in place that prevents the accidental deletion of resources in Azure. You can associate the lock with a subscription, resource group, or resource. Locks are inherited by child resources. Screenshot of the Management locks page.","1:
**How does the concept of Resource Groups in Azure help in managing resources with different lifecycles, and what are the key considerations when defining a Resource Group?**","Resource Groups in Azure serve as a logical collection of resources that share the same lifecycle, meaning you typically deploy, update, and delete them together. When defining a Resource Group, it's crucial to consider the lifecycle of the resources included. If a resource, such as a database server, requires a different deployment cycle than the other resources, it should be placed in a separate Resource Group. Additionally, each resource can only exist in one Resource Group at a time, but you can move resources between groups if needed, keeping in mind that limitations exist. Resource Groups can contain resources of various types and from different regions, and they play a significant role in scoping access control for administrative tasks."

**What are Azure Resource Manager locks, and how do they help prevent accidental deletions of resources in Azure?**","Azure Resource Manager locks are a feature that helps prevent the accidental deletion or modification of resources in Azure. An administrator can associate a lock with a subscription, a Resource Group, or an individual resource. Once applied, the lock is inherited by child resources, providing an additional layer of protection against errors that could result in the loss of critical data or configurations. This is particularly useful in scenarios where an over-zealous or careless administrator might accidentally delete resources, as the lock enforces a structure that requires deliberate actions to remove or alter resources, thereby safeguarding against unintended deletions."
"In the Settings options, Locks are highlighted and in the Add Lock page, the Lock type, Ready-only, and Delete option are displayed and highlighted. Lock types
There are two types of resource locks. Read-Only locks, which prevent any changes to the resource. Delete locks, which prevent deletion. Note

Only the Owner and User Access Administrator roles can create or delete management locks. Next unit: Reorganize Azure resources

5- Reorganize Azure resources

Sometimes you may need to move resources to either a new subscription or a new resource group in the same subscription. Diagram showing two subscriptions. When moving resources, both the source group and the target group are locked during the operation. Write and delete operations are blocked on the resource groups until the move completes. This lock means you can't add, update, or delete resources in the resource groups. Locks don't mean the resources aren't available. For example, if you move a virtual machine to a new resource group, an application can still access the virtual machine. Limitations
Before beginning this process be sure to read the Move operation support for resources page. This page details what resources can be moved between resources group, subscriptions, and regions. Implementation
To move resources, select the resource group containing those resources, and then select the Move button. Select the resources to move and the destination resource group. Acknowledge that you need to update scripts. Screenshot of the Move a Resource page. Note

Just because a service can be moved doesn’t mean there aren’t restrictions. For example, you can move a virtual network, but you must also move its dependent resources, like gateways. Next unit: Remove resources and resource groups

6- Remove resources and resource groups

Use caution when deleting a resource group. Deleting a resource group deletes all the resources contained within it. That resource group might contain resources that resources in other resource groups depend on. Screenshot showing the Delete resource group button (highlighted) in the portal. Using PowerShell to delete resource groups
To remove a resource group use, Remove-AzResourceGroup. In this example, we are removing the ContosoRG01 resource group from the subscription. The cmdlet prompts you for confirmation and returns no output. Copy
Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name ""ContosoRG01""

Removing resources
You can also delete individual resources within a resource group. For example, here we are deleting a virtual network. Instead, of deleting you can move the resource to another resource group.","1. **Question:** What are the different types of locks available in Azure, and what are their primary functions?","In Azure, there are two types of resource locks: Read-Only locks and Delete locks. A Read-Only lock prevents any changes to the resource, effectively making it immutable. This means you cannot modify the resource in any way, although you can still read its data. On the other hand, a Delete lock prevents the deletion of the resource. It ensures that the resource cannot be removed until the lock is lifted. Both types of locks can only be created or deleted by users with Owner or User Access Administrator roles.

2. **Question:** What precautions should be taken when moving resources between resource groups or subscriptions in Azure?"
