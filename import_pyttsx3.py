Real-Time Whisper Transcription with a Microphone Since you've optimized faster-whisper for GPU inference, let's now connect a microphone and stream live transcription in real time. Install the Required Dependencies. Run this in your terminal: sh Copy Edit pip install sounddevice numpy sounddevice → Captures audio from your microphone. numpy → Converts audio data into a format Whisper can process. Full Microphone Streaming Script This script will: Listen continuously from your microphone. Stream live transcriptions in real-time. Process everything on your RTX 4090 GPU. Adjusting for Maximum Speed Reduce BLOCK_SIZE to 2048 for lower latency. Use tiny model instead of small for real-time results. Keep vad_filter=True → It removes background noise & silences. What's Next? Sending Transcriptions to LLaMA Now that Whisper transcribes in real-time, we can send each transcript to a lightweight LLM like LLaMA, Mistral, or Gemma for generating smart responses. Would you like me to: Integrate LLaMA? Show how to stream responses back in real-time? Let me know how far you want to go with this setup! ", "test_audio.mp3")
